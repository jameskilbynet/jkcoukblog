This meant that new Unifi devices could not find the Unifi server for adoption/control purposes as this is usually done with broadcast. Layer 3 Adoption Options For Remote Adoption/Layer 3 UniFi supports: SSH DNS DHCP Option 43 I discounted SSH as who wants to manually log into things and make changes and I discounted DNS. That left me with DHCP option 43 I decided to configure my DHCP server to hand out “option 43” on the network subnet the Access Points were connected to. The implementation of this will differ depending on what DHCP server you are using. Mine is th",

But technically it’s possible if I dropped all drive redundancy… I recently saw an advert for a server that was just too good to be true. It promised to bring a huge amount of storage and future options in a quite hard-to-believe 1U. The price it was on offer for was also unreal.

What started life as a move away from gigabit networking had some serious scope creep. As I needed new switches, network adaptors and cabling I evaluated the obvious choice of just upgrading to 10Gb/s. However, when looking at the price comparison to upgrade to 25Gb/s I felt the cost uplift was justified and certainly better future-proofed. This became the baseline for the majority of my server workloads. The Access switch layer has basically stayed gigabit but with 10Gb/s uplinks.

This is an interesting topic as VMC is technically “as a service” therefore the monitoring approach is a bit different. Technically AWS and VMware’s SRE teams will be monitoring all of the infrastructure components, however, you still need to monitor your Virtual Machines. If it was me I would still want some monitoring of the Infrastructure and I see two different reasons why you would want to do this: Firstly I want to check that the VMware Cloud on AWS service is doing what I am paying for.

Due to the non-disclosure agreement, I can’t talk about any specific questions however I will say that the questions and the focus have changed quite significantly since I sat the exam a few years ago.  Like AWS itself they were at the cutting edge of the industry and the number of services they now offer is extreme, adding to the challenge of the exam.  I am now good fo",

Since starting my new role with Xtravirt my Homelab has gone through several fairly significant changes.  At the moment it’s very much focused on the VMware stack and one of the things I needed was some more storage and especially some more storage performance.  With that in mind, I purchased a new Synology DS918 It’s a very compact unit with a quad-core Intel Celeron & I have left the RAM at 4 GB for now. I have added some of the existing SSD’s that I had giving me about 3TB of usable flash.  I am presenting this back to my VMware hosts using NFS 4.1.   I must have missed the announcement as this is now built into the Synology GUI ( It used to be a command-line-only option) I have verified the VAAI works as expected in this configuration.  At present I am using this w",

I don’t think it’s an understatement to say I probably wouldn’t have my current role within VMware without it. One of the best benefits has been access to a huge amount of licences for VMware software to use in my lab. Some third parties have also recognised the award and given licences for their software. Two that I have probably made the most use of is Runecast and Devolutions Remote Desktop Manager. However recently a few bits of hardware have become available and one piece in particular peeked my interest in particular some Optane drives thanks to the very generous folks at Intel.

Throughout that time Cloudflare has been improving there capabilities and approximately 2 years ago I decided to move this blog into their worker’s product. This meant that the site was 100% served from their datacenter’s rather than just cached assets as done in the previous config. This had several distinct benefits. It improved the site’s performance significantly, especially for anyone outside of the UK. It effectively became unhackable (as the content is all static) and it meant that if my home connection was offline it would not impact the site. They have made deployment easier so I thought I would document how I ",

One of the really cool features I wanted to mention today was the remediation script function. I have been playing with storage a lot in my lab recently as part of a wider storage migration piece but also as part of testing Intel Optane drives. Runecast flagged up that I didn’t have Storage I/O Control enabled for these data stores. It gave a great overview of what that issue means: It is a good practice to enable SIOC, especially in environments where storage is overutilized. SIOC monitors the latency of I/Os to data stores at each ESX host sharing that device. When the average normalized datastore latency exceeds a set threshold (30ms by",

( I will just refer to this as TrueNAS) This is based on my HP Z840 and I have now retired my faithful Synology DS918+ and DX517 expansion bay. (Those have gone to fellow vExperts Paul Wilk and Kev Johnson) I loved the Synology ecosystem and I still believe it’s probably the easiest to get up and running and offers a very easy-to-use and performant system. Combine this with a large number of additional apps available together with docker it is very customisable. It makes an excellent entry into homelab storage at a relatively low cost.

This is all due to the pending acquisition by Broadcom. There are a lot of unknowns for the staff and customers about what the company will look like in the future. I certainly have some concerns mainly just with the unknown. However, VMware has a great reputation for doing the right thing around its staff, customers, and the wider world. Yesterday the entire company was off on one of VMware’s so-called EPIC days. I spent the day with my family on the beach.

This was something I had dabbled with in the past but never really had the time or need to get working properly. The first thing that I needed was a GPU. I did have a Dell T20 with an iGPU built into the CPU but I wanted a more enterprise card for my testing. I therefore decided to pick up a Nvidia Tesla P4 from eBay for the princely sum of £185. The card stats are not impressive by modern standards but it was good enough for what I needed combined with the fact that it was a single-width PCIe 3.0 x16 card and didn’t require external power. An important note is that this is a passively cooled card so if it’s not located in a server with a reasonable airflow t",

Because they have a large number of POP’s they can cache and push content closer to your end users to give them a better experience. This also offloads work from your firewalls, DNS, Web and Database servers.  At present they have 139 sites globally allowing you to host a site anywhere and get good global performance.

The required knowledge was certainly wider than the vSAN specialist exam. This was my third remote proctored exam and I must say the experience has improved. Partially that is down to Pearson Vue improving the process and partially down to knowing what to expect a bit better. Together with the vSAN exam that I passed earlier in the month, this entitles me to a VMware Master Services Competency. This is now the second that I hold and I must say I like the way VMwa",

How you handle that can be a big differentiator. With VMware Cloud on AWS, the hosts are monitored 24×7 by VMware/AWS Support all as part of the service. If you pay for X number of hosts you should have X. That includes during maintenance and failure operations.

Looking at the log extract above a new host was being provisioned the same minute the issue was identified.

This is based on the i3en.metal AWS instance. The specifications are certainly impressive packing in 96 logical cores, 768GiB RAM, and approximately 45.84 TiB of NVMe raw storage capacity per host. It’s certainly a monster with a 266% uplift in CPU, a 50% increase in RAM and a whopping 440% increase in raw storage per host compared to the i3. Most of the engagements I have worked on so far have discovered that they are storage limited requiring extra hosts to handle the required storage footprint. With such a big uplift in Storage capacity hopefully, this will trend towards filling up CPU, RAM & Storage at the same time. This is the panacea of Hyperconvergence. The other two noticeable changes are th",

The online training is delivered over a pretty modern platform and is done in a way to keep you engaged. The Labs aren’t super complicated but are buried in the training as opposed to a separate task. I think I prefer this approach.

This involves driving from the south coast of Dorset up to Scotland and then getting a ferry over to Belfast before travelling west to the Republic. While driving I got a slack notification that one of my SSD’s in my Synology DS918+ was in a bad way. (You do have notifications set up right? ) The timing could not have been worse. Now for years anyone that I have talked to at VMUG’s around data protection etc, I have advocating never using RAID 5. The reasons for this are well known. But when it’s your homelab and your wallet is in the line corners sometimes need to be cut. When I got to Ireland I logged into the Synology it was pretty obvious it wasn’t happy Unhappy Array ( F",

So with the release of vSphere 8 I was obviously going to upgrade however a few personal things blocked me from doing it until now. The vCenter upgrade was smooth however knowing that some of the hardware I am running is a little dated this was always going to carry a risk. I tried using lifecycle manager (vLCM) within vCenter but I was faced with the following and I couldn’t see a way to force remediate from within vCenter. Therefore I resorted to doing it from the command line.

Then MikroTik dropped the CRS504-4XQ-IN and if the price wasn’t horrendous then that was the route I was going to go to alleviate these issues. Yes, it’s 100Gb/s and only has 4 ports but that should be all I need… I managed to locate one in stock for £587 plus Vat As you can see the switch has redundant power not often found at this price point. It actually has 4 ways to power it. 2 AC supplies, A DC input and then strangest of all it can be powered by POE in. This last point showcases how power efficient it is which is a huge win for a h",

The refresh was triggered by the purchase of a SuperMicro Server (2027TR-H71FRF) chassis with 4x X9DRT Nodes / Blades. This is known as a BigTwin configuration in SuperMicro parlance. This is something I was very familiar with as most of the Nutanix nodes that we deployed at Zen were of this design. Each node has 2x Intel Xeon CPU E5-2670 @ 2.60GHz 3 Nodes have 192GB of RAM and 1 has 128GB giving a combined 64c/128t and 704GB of RAM. Quite an amount to be squeezed into 2U.

I will likely virtualise this in the future. In terms of network/switching I have moved to an intermediate step here vMotion and Storage are running over DAC’s while VMware management and VM traffic is still over 1Gb/s networking. This is working incredibly well. Due to the onboard network cards I am able to vMotion at 40Gb/s which for a home lab is game-changing. Storage is currently over 25Gb/s and the long-term plan is to get a 25Gb/s switch. The contenders at the moment are a Used Dell enterprise switch or possibly a QNAP box.

I have now moved this site permanently over to them. This is partly related to some issues I have been having with internet access at home. Prior to this, the site ran from within my lab. This means the site is now super fast (hopefully :p). It was cached by Cloudflare previously and now it’s served entirely from within their network. The speed report looks good To enable this workflow I have retained a WordPress instance running within a docker instance on my Synology. I have also set up Cloudflare teams to access this. This allows me to have the convenience of utilising WordPress as a CMS without having to worry about the security aspect as all public content is static. It also means that I don’t care about the uptime of ",

This is in addition to my Synology DS918+ TrueNas is the successor to FreeNas a very popular BSD based StorageOS and TrueNas scale is a fork of this based on Linux. The Synology has been an amazing piece of kit handling VM storage, Docker, File sharing and Plex duties. It will maintain most of these roles. However, I needed something faster for my lab and especially something with faster network access. The Synology I had was limited to 2xGb interfaces. An option was to buy a newer Synology but I felt a better route was to try a “Storage OS” on some of my existing hardware with some network tweaks to be seen later. T",
