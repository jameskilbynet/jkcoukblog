I don’t think it’s an understatement to say I probably wouldn’t have my current role within VMware without it. One of the best benefits has been access to a huge amount of licences for VMware software to use in my lab. Some third parties have also recognised the award and given licences for their software. Two that I have probably made the most use of is Runecast and Devolutions Remote Desktop Manager.

This time I went for the retina version with 16Gb of RAM and  512GB PCIe-based SSD.  The spec was certainly good enough for 99% of my needs yet still being lighter and with better battery life than a MacBook Pro. It also has the security benefits of the T2 Security chip I also thought it was time to tidy up and publish my Mac build scripts for anyone else to use.  They are available below and hopefully pretty easy for anyone to follow.

I bought a beautiful Dell 49″ monitor back in mid-2020 that has been the central focus of my home office. With this setup I always had my trusty Macbook Air shut as I have no need for any more screen estate. This caused some challenges for video calls with the ever-present Zoom/Teams as the webcam I was using was no longer available. I tried a few options to improve this but they were all a bit suboptimal. I decided to do a few drastic upgrades over the last month or so. This post is to show exactly what I’m running as of January 2021. A few people have asked m",

The required knowledge was certainly wider than the vSAN specialist exam. This was my third remote proctored exam and I must say the experience has improved. Partially that is down to Pearson Vue improving the process and partially down to knowing what to expect a bit better.

This is based on the i3en.metal AWS instance. The specifications are certainly impressive packing in 96 logical cores, 768GiB RAM, and approximately 45.84 TiB of NVMe raw storage capacity per host. It’s certainly a monster with a 266% uplift in CPU, a 50% increase in RAM and a whopping 440% increase in raw storage per host compared to the i3. Most of the engagements I have worked on so far have discovered that they are storage limited requiring extra hosts to handle the required storage footprint. With such a big uplift in Storage capacity hopefully, this will trend towards filling up CPU, RAM & Storage at the same time. This is the panacea of Hyperconvergence. Th",

After a while I received an email from Cloudflare saying: Hi, You’re 50% of the way to reaching one of your daily Cloudflare Workers KV free tier limits. You can view complete usage information in the dashboard. If you do not take any action and exceed the daily limit, requests to the Workers KV API will return 429 errors, and operations within a worker will fail until the limit resets at 2022-01-05 at 00:00:00 UTC. I decided to keep ploughing on with my changes to see what happens when I go over this. ",

I will likely virtualise this in the future. In terms of network/switching I have moved to an intermediate step here vMotion and Storage are running over DAC’s while VMware management and VM traffic is still over 1Gb/s networking. This is working incredibly well. Due to the onboard network cards I am able to vMotion at 40Gb/s which for a home lab is game-changing. Storage is currently over 25Gb/s and the long-term plan is to get a 25Gb/s switch. The contenders at the moment are a Used Dell enterprise switch or possibly a QNAP box.

I have now moved this site permanently over to them. This is partly related to some issues I have been having with internet access at home. Prior to this, the site ran from within my lab. This means the site is now super fast (hopefully :p). It was cached by Cloudflare previously and now it’s served entirely from within their network. The speed report looks good To enable this workflow I have retained a WordPress instance running within a docker instance on my Synology. I have also set up Cloudflare teams to access this. This allows me to have the convenience of utilising WordPress as a CMS without having to worry about the security aspect as all public content is st",

This is in addition to my Synology DS918+ TrueNas is the successor to FreeNas a very popular BSD based StorageOS and TrueNas scale is a fork of this based on Linux. The Synology has been an amazing piece of kit handling VM storage, Docker, File sharing and Plex duties. It will maintain most of these roles. However, I needed something faster for my lab and especially something with faster network access. The Synology I had was limited to 2xGb interfaces. An option was to buy a newer Synology but I felt a better route was to try a “Storage OS” on some of my existing hardware with some network tweaks to be seen l",
