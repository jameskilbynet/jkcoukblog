It had been on my todo list for a good number of years. With the current pause in the Broadcom VMware takeover deal. I had some downtime and decided to use one of the three exam vouchers VMware give me each year. This upgrades me to a a VMware Certified Advanced Professional.\n\nThe VCAP Deploy exams are lab based and use a similar infrastructure to the hands on labs. In my experience the whole setup was quite slick. If you know your way around vSphere pretty comprehensively or have done the appropriate studying then I think it was a fair assessment. The [blueprint](https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/certification/vmware-advanced-deploy-exam-guide.pdf) covers everything you need. So whats stopping you…\n\nI have now scheduled the VCAP-Design exam and hopefully I will be able to pass that and receive the VCIX award.\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Using Content Libraries in VMC to deploy software faster](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/01/using-content-libraries-in-vmc-to-deploy-software-faster/)\n  * [vSAN Cluster Shutdown &#8211; Orchestration](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/12/vsan-cluster-shutdown/)\n  * [An in-depth look at VMware Cloud on AWS hosts](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/08/vmc-host-deepdive/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![Holodeck CPU Fixes](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/40oOd8IipPvtrPJs-1198788743-768x737.jpg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/01/holodeck-cpu-fixes/)\n\n[VCF](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/vcf/) | [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/)\n\n### [Holodeck CPU Fixes](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/01/holodeck-cpu-fixes/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) January 18, 2024July 10, 2024\n\nHow to deploy Holodeck with Legacy CPU’s\n\n  * [ ![AWS Solution Architect – Associate](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/AmazonWebservices_Logo.svg_-768x307.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2019/12/aws-solution-architect-associate/)\n\n[AWS](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/aws/) | [Personal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/personal/)\n\n### [AWS Solution Architect – Associate](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2019/12/aws-solution-architect-associate/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) December 16, 2019December 4, 2025\n\nToday was a good day. I renewed my AWS Solution Architect certification.

The refresh was triggered by the purchase of a SuperMicro Server (2027TR-H71FRF) chassis with 4x X9DRT Nodes / Blades. This is known as a BigTwin configuration in SuperMicro parlance.

I have now moved this site permanently over to them. This is partly related to some issues I have been having with internet access at home. Prior to this, the site ran from within my lab.
