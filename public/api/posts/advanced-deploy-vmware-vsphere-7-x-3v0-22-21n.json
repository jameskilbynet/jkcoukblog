It had been on my todo list for a good number of years. With the current pause in the Broadcom VMware takeover deal. I had some downtime and decided to use one of the three exam vouchers VMware give me each year.

In my experience the whole setup was quite slick. If you know your way around vSphere pretty comprehensively or have done the appropriate studying then I think it was a fair assessment. The [blueprint](https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/certification/vmware-advanced-deploy-exam-guide.pdf) covers everything you need. So whats stopping you…\n\nI have now scheduled the VCAP-Design exam and hopefully I will be able to pass that and receive the VCIX award.\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Using Content Libraries in VMC to deploy software faster](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/01/using-content-libraries-in-vmc-to-deploy-software-faster/)\n  * [Automating the deployment of my Homelab AI Infrastructure](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/01/automating-the-deployment-of-my-ai-homelab-and-other-improvements/)\n  * [vSAN Cluster Shutdown &#8211; Orchestration](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/12/vsan-cluster-shutdown/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![Web Development](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/iu-2-768x229.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/01/web-development/)\n\n[Hosting](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/hosting/) | [Cloudflare](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/cloudflare/) | [Personal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/personal/) | [Wordpress](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/wordpress/)\n\n### [Web Development](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/01/web-development/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) January 4, 2022October 1, 2025\n\nA while ago I started messing with Cloudflare Workers.
