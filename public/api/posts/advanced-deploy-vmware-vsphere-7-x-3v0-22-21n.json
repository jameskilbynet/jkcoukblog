It had been on my todo list for a good number of years. With the current pause in the Broadcom VMware takeover deal. I had some downtime and decided to use one of the three exam vouchers VMware give me each year. This upgrades me to a a VMware Certified Advanced Professional.\n\nThe VCAP Deploy exams are lab based and use a similar infrastructure to the hands on labs. In my experience the whole setup was quite slick. If you know your way around vSphere pretty comprehensively or have done the appropriate studying then I think it was a fair assessment. The [blueprint](https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/certification/vmware-advanced-deploy-exam-guide.pdf) covers everything you need. So whats stopping you…\n\nI have now scheduled the VCAP-Design exam and hopefully I will be able to pass that and receive the VCIX award.\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![VMC – vSAN ESA](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/OrigionalPoweredByvSAN-550x324-1.jpg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/11/vsan-esa-and-the-improvements-it-brings-to-vmc/)\n\n[VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/) | [VMware Cloud on AWS](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/vmware-cloud-on-aws/) | [vSAN](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/vsan-vmware/)\n\n### [VMC – vSAN ESA](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/11/vsan-esa-and-the-improvements-it-brings-to-vmc/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) November 17, 2023July 10, 2024\n\nAn Overview of vSAN ESA in VMC \n\n  * [ ![Analytics in a privacy focused world](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/plausible-analytics-icon-top.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/11/analytics-in-a-privacy-focused-world/)\n\n[Hosting](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/hosting/) | [Personal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/personal/)\n\n### [Analytics in a privacy focused world](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/11/analytics-in-a-privacy-focused-world/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) November 10, 2023October 1, 2025\n\nI recently helped my friend Dean Lewis @veducate with some hosting issues.
