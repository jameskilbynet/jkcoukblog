Nvidia’s stock price has gone to the moon. So I thought I better get some knowledge and understand some of this.\n\nAs it’s a huge field and I wasn’t exactly sure where to start I decided to follow [Tim’s](https://www.youtube.com/@TechnoTim) excellent [video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrLpdfhTwLg)and [guide](https://technotim.live/posts/ai-stack-tutorial/) as to what he has deployed. This blog is a bit more of a reminder for me as what I have done. I wont go into all the details as Tim has done a better job than I will. \n\n## Table of Contents\n\n## Introduction\n\nYes, you can do some AI things with a CPU but the reality at the moment is that it’s better suited to being executed on a GPU and depending on what you’re doing a GPU(s) with lots of memory are what you need. I didn’t fancy spending any money so I thought I would start with my Nvidia P4 and see where I get to.\n\n### Nvidia Tesla P4 Specs\n\nThe Nvidia P4 has 8GB of DDR5 memory which is enough for running some smaller models \n\n### OS Choice\n\nI chose to use one of my vSphere Hosts with a VM running Ubuntu 24.04 VM \n\n### vHardware Spec\n\nIn vSphere, I allocated 8x vCPUs, 20GB of memory, and 256GB of storage to the VM with the P4 passed in directly. This means I didn’t need any additional NVIDIA licences.\n\nInstall Ubuntu 24.04 ( or use your template) & make sure it’s patched\n    \n    \n    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\n📋 Copy\n\n## Install NVIDIA Software\n\nThe first step is to install the Nvidia drivers.\n    \n    \n    sudo ubuntu-drivers install \n    \n\n📋 Copy\n\nreboot and then use “sudo nvidia-smi” to validate that the card is now functioning within the VM. The output below shows that the Ubuntu server can see the Tesla P4\n    \n    \n    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n    | NVIDIA-SMI 470.256.02   Driver Version: 470.256.02   CUDA Version: 11.4     |\n    |-------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\n    | GPU  Name        Persistence-M| Bus-Id        Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.

This allows containers to interact with the graphics card\n    \n    \n    curl -fsSL https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg \\\n      && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/stable/deb/nvidia-container-toolkit.list | \\\n        sed 's#deb https://#deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg] https://#g' | \\\n        sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list\n\n📋 Copy\n\nsudo apt-get update\n    \n    \n    sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit\n\n📋 Copy\n    \n    \n    sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker\n    sudo systemctl restart docker\n\n📋 Copy\n\nTest NVIDIA Docker\n    \n    \n    sudo docker run --rm --runtime=nvidia --gpus all ubuntu nvidia-smi\n\n📋 Copy\n\nIf the above worked, you have a functioning system where docker can communicate with your GPU.\n\n## Overview\n\nTim’s blog has a decent overview of the containers and what they are doing so I won’t detail it here.\n\n## Chat in Action\n\nSo the next obvious thing I needed to do was ask it some questions. So I asked the gemma2 model the question “What AI models can I run on a Nvidia p4?”\n\nand it answered….\n\nYou’re right to be specific! While the Nvidia P4 is _technically_ an AI-capable GPU, it’s designed more for inference (running pre-trained models) than training complex ones from scratch. Think of it like a powerful calculator for AI, not a research lab.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of what you can realistically expect on an Nvidia P4:\n\n**1\\. Lightweight Models are Your Friend:**\n\n  * **Object Detection:** Tiny YOLOv3 variants or lightweight MobileNet-based detectors. Expect lower accuracy than bigger models but fast inference speeds for real-time applications.\n  * **Image Classification:** MobileNet V2, Inception v3 (downscaled), SqueezeNet – these are pre-trained and optimized for mobile devices.\n\n**2\\. Frameworks Matter:**\n\n  * **TensorRT** : This is Nvidia’s specialized engine for P4. It optimizes your models for performance, even converting them into a more efficient format.\n  * **ONNX Runtime** : This open-source runtime supports various AI frameworks, and can be used to run models on the P4 after conversion.\n\n**3\\. Practical Applications:**\n\n  * **Edge Devices:** Think smart cameras, embedded systems, or robotics where low power consumption and quick responses are crucial.\n  * **Demo Projects:** Great for learning about deployment and seeing how AI works in real-time, even if the accuracy isn’t state-of-the-art.\n\n**What You CAN’T Do:**\n\n  * Train massive neural networks from scratch (think GPT-3 or large image generators). The P4 lacks the memory and compute power.\n  * Run cutting-edge research models that demand immense resources. Those are best left to specialized cloud GPUs or supercomputers.\n\nLet me know if you have a specific AI task in mind – I might be able to suggest suitable pre-trained models or optimizations for your Nvidia P4 setup!\n\nAs a response, I was certainly impressed with it\n\n## Power Consumption\n\nObviously, I am very aware of the power usage on my lab so I thought it was interesting to dig into how this much running chat queries may impact things. According to NVTOP The P4 normally idles around 7 Watts, however, once a model is loaded even if its not running any queries this increases to around 24W this is probably due to the increased memory clock speed.\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-05-at-11.57.47.png)Idle consumption ![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-05-at-12.01.26.png)Models loaded ![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-16-at-14.41.52.png)Models Running\n\nWhen queries are running it will typically use 50-60 watts.\n\n## Summary \n\nObviously it’s early days for my experimentation into what is a large and rapidly changing field. But it’s certainly something I will be playing with a lot.\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Warp &#8211; The intelligent terminal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/04/warp-the-intelligent-terminal/)\n  * [How I Migrated from Pocket to Hoarder with AI Integration](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/01/how-i-migrated-from-pocket-to-hoarder-and-introduced-some-ai-along-the-way/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![How to Fix Portainer Agent not Starting On Synology DSM](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Docker-Symbol-1-2199360526-768x528.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/03/portainer-agent-on-synology-dsm/)\n\n[Docker](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/docker/) | [Portainer](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/portainer/) | [Synology](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/synology/)\n\n### [How to Fix Portainer Agent not Starting On Synology DSM](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/03/portainer-agent-on-synology-dsm/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) March 11, 2025December 27, 2025\n\nHow to fix Portainer Agent no starting on Synology\n\n  * [Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/) | [Veeam](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/veeam/) | [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/)\n\n### [Lab Update – Desired Workloads](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/01/lab-update-part-5-desired-workloads/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) January 6, 2022November 11, 2023\n\nMy lab is always undergoing change.
