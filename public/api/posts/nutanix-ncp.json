They are also offering free on-demand training to go with it. In my current role, I haven’t used Nutanix however I have good experience using it as the storage platform with vSphere and have also run the Nutanix CE software both physically and nested to give me a better overview of the AHV platform.\n\nThe online training is delivered over a pretty modern platform and is done in a way to keep you engaged. The Labs aren’t super complicated but are buried in the training as opposed to a separate task. I think I prefer this approach.\n\nThis was the first online proctored exam for me so the experience was a bit different. I initially had some issues getting the software to recognise my web camera. After a bit of troubleshooting, this was resolved and the exam began. The questions were fair and followed the blueprint and the time allocated was ample for me.\n\nI wasn’t confident when I pressed the submit button but the results came back instantly and luckily I passed. They also give you a breakdown of how you scored in the various sections this is a really useful piece of feedback that several tests deprive you of.\n\nAll in all top work Nutanix\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![And now for something completely different](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/fWbXybA7-768x193.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2018/10/and-now-for-something-completely-different/)\n\n[Personal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/personal/)\n\n### [And now for something completely different](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2018/10/and-now-for-something-completely-different/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) October 16, 2018July 10, 2024\n\nI have worked for my current employer Zen Internet for 3.5 years.
