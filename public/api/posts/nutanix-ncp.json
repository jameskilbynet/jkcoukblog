They are also offering free on-demand training to go with it. In my current role, I haven’t used Nutanix however I have good experience using it as the storage platform with vSphere and have also run the Nutanix CE software both physically and nested to give me a better overview of the AHV platform.\n\nThe online training is delivered over a pretty modern platform and is done in a way to keep you engaged. The Labs aren’t super complicated but are buried in the training as opposed to a separate task. I think I prefer this approach.\n\nThis was the first online proctored exam for me so the experience was a bit different. I initially had some issues getting the software to recognise my web camera. After a bit of troubleshooting, this was resolved and the exam began. The questions were fair and followed the blueprint and the time allocated was ample for me.\n\nI wasn’t confident when I pressed the submit button but the results came back instantly and luckily I passed. They also give you a breakdown of how you scored in the various sections this is a really useful piece of feedback that several tests deprive you of.\n\nAll in all top work Nutanix\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![AWS Solution Architect – Associate](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/AmazonWebservices_Logo.svg_-768x307.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2019/12/aws-solution-architect-associate/)\n\n[AWS](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/aws/) | [Personal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/personal/)\n\n### [AWS Solution Architect – Associate](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2019/12/aws-solution-architect-associate/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) December 16, 2019December 4, 2025\n\nToday was a good day.

This is all due to the pending acquisition by Broadcom. There are a lot of unknowns for the staff and customers about what the company will look like in the future.
