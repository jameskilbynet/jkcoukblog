It has been running without a hitch for nearly a month now at **effectively zero cost**\n\n#### Site Response\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screen-Shot-2018-05-15-at-22.39.01.png)\n\nThe guide I followed is very good and is documented in the Git repo [here](https://lambstatus.github.io/set-up-custom-http-s-monitoring/)\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Monitoring VMC &#8211; Part 1](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2019/12/monitoring-vmc-part-1/)\n  * [AWS Solution Architect &#8211; Associate](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2019/12/aws-solution-architect-associate/)\n  * [AWS for Beginners](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2018/03/aws-for-beginners1/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![Cloudflare Workers – Limits of the free tier](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/iu-768x450.jpeg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/01/cloudflare-workers-limits-of-the-free-tier/)\n\n[Hosting](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/hosting/) | [Wordpress](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/wordpress/)\n\n### [Cloudflare Workers – Limits of the free tier](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/01/cloudflare-workers-limits-of-the-free-tier/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) January 4, 2022April 9, 2023\n\nI have been making several changes (mainly cosmetic to this site over the last day or so) On most changes I have been doing an export and then uploading the site to Cloudflare using Wrangler.

This is an interesting topic as VMC is technically “as a service” therefore the monitoring approach is a bit different.
