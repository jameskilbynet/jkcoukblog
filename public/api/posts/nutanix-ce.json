However, due to the fairly high requirements, it didn’t make sense to me to continue running it at home. This was compounded by the fact that I have many clusters to play with at work. These all run my Hypervisor of choice vSphere so I thought it was about time to see what was new with AHV and Nutanix CE\n\nI downloaded the latest copy of CE from the Nutanix site and extracted it to a USB stick with [Rufus.](https://rufus.akeo.ie/) (This took about 30 mins)\n\nThe server that I chose to run this on was the same server I ran initially. a Dell T20 with the Xeon processor 32GB of RAM 1x240GB SSD and 1x3TB WD Red. The installation is pretty straightforward and covered a lot elsewhere.\n\nI am just kicking the tyres with it at the moment and running a few VM’s. I have also shared the storage from my Nutanix CE setup back to my vSphere environment.\n\nIll post back with some updates of what I get up to with it\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![Homelab bad days \\(almost\\)](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/BrokenHardDive-1200x630-1-768x403.jpg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/11/homelab-bad-days-almost/)\n\n[Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/) | [Storage](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/storage/) | [Synology](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/synology/)\n\n### [Homelab bad days (almost)](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/11/homelab-bad-days-almost/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) November 21, 2022April 8, 2023\n\nI recently spent 3 weeks in Ireland with my wife Wendy and our son Nate.
