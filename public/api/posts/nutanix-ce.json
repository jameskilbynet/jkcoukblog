However, due to the fairly high requirements, it didn’t make sense to me to continue running it at home. This was compounded by the fact that I have many clusters to play with at work. These all run my Hypervisor of choice vSphere so I thought it was about time to see what was new with AHV and Nutanix CE\n\nI downloaded the latest copy of CE from the Nutanix site and extracted it to a USB stick with [Rufus.](https://rufus.akeo.ie/) (This took about 30 mins)\n\nThe server that I chose to run this on was the same server I ran initially. a Dell T20 with the Xeon processor 32GB of RAM 1x240GB SSD and 1x3TB WD Red. The installation is pretty straightforward and covered a lot elsewhere.\n\nI am just kicking the tyres with it at the moment and running a few VM’s. I have also shared the storage from my Nutanix CE setup back to my vSphere environment.\n\nIll post back with some updates of what I get up to with it\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Automating the deployment of my Homelab AI Infrastructure](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/02/automating-the-deployment-of-my-ai-homelab-and-other-improvements/)\n  * [Managing my Homelab with SemaphoreUI](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/09/managing-my-homelab-with-semaphoreui/)\n  * [Warp &#8211; The intelligent terminal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/04/warp-the-intelligent-terminal/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![Self Hosting AI Stack using vSphere, Docker and NVIDIA GPU](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/pexels-tara-winstead-8386440-768x512.jpg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/10/self-hosting-ai-stack-using-vsphere-docker-and-nvidia-gpu/)\n\n[Artificial Intelligence](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/artificial-intelligence/) | [Docker](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/docker/) | [Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/)\n\n### [Self Hosting AI Stack using vSphere, Docker and NVIDIA GPU](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/10/self-hosting-ai-stack-using-vsphere-docker-and-nvidia-gpu/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) October 11, 2024October 1, 2025\n\nArtificial intelligence is all the rage at the moment, It’s getting included in every product announcement from pretty much every vendor under the sun.
