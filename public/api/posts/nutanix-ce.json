However, due to the fairly high requirements, it didn’t make sense to me to continue running it at home. This was compounded by the fact that I have many clusters to play with at work. These all run my Hypervisor of choice vSphere so I thought it was about time to see what was new with AHV and Nutanix CE\n\nI downloaded the latest copy of CE from the Nutanix site and extracted it to a USB stick with [Rufus.](https://rufus.akeo.ie/) (This took about 30 mins)\n\nThe server that I chose to run this on was the same server I ran initially. a Dell T20 with the Xeon processor 32GB of RAM 1x240GB SSD and 1x3TB WD Red. The installation is pretty straightforward and covered a lot elsewhere.\n\nI am just kicking the tyres with it at the moment and running a few VM’s. I have also shared the storage from my Nutanix CE setup back to my vSphere environment.\n\nIll post back with some updates of what I get up to with it\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Automating the deployment of my Homelab AI Infrastructure](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/02/automating-the-deployment-of-my-ai-homelab-and-other-improvements/)\n  * [Managing my Homelab with SemaphoreUI](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/09/managing-my-homelab-with-semaphoreui/)\n  * [Warp &#8211; The intelligent terminal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/04/warp-the-intelligent-terminal/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![Managing my Homelab with SemaphoreUI](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/semaphore-768x768.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/09/managing-my-homelab-with-semaphoreui/)\n\n[Ansible](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/ansible/) | [Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/)\n\n### [Managing my Homelab with SemaphoreUI](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/09/managing-my-homelab-with-semaphoreui/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) September 2, 2025February 1, 2026\n\nAn intro on how I use SemaphoreUI to manage my Homelab\n\n  * [ ![Nutanix Command Reference Guide](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nutanix-logo-HI-REZ_reverse-w-carrier-768x196.jpg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2018/06/nutanix-command-reference-guide/)\n\n[Nutanix](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/nutanix/)\n\n### [Nutanix Command Reference Guide](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2018/06/nutanix-command-reference-guide/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) June 5, 2018July 10, 2024\n\nA list of useful Nutanix Commands\n\n  * [ ![Use Portainer in a Homelab with GitHub](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/22225832.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/12/use-portainer-in-a-homelab-with-github/)\n\n[Docker](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/docker/) | [Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/) | [Hosting](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/hosting/) | [Kubernetes](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/kubernetes/)\n\n### [Use Portainer in a Homelab with GitHub](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/12/use-portainer-in-a-homelab-with-github/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) December 9, 2022October 1, 2025\n\nLate to the party or not, I have been using containers in my lab more and more and that has led me to Portainer….
