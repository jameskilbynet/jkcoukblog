Over that time I have changed roles from what was originally a customer-focused role into a role with one of the core platform teams. This has meant looking after the majority of the Internal and customer Virtual platforms. During this time Zen has undergone several large migration programs and countless smaller ones. Some of the big ones include:\n\n  * [Core ISP network refresh](https://www.zen.co.uk/blog/posts/zen-blog/2018/02/09/how-plexus-came-about)\n  * [Microsegmentation rollout](https://www.vmware.com/uk/products/nsx.html)\n  * [Nutanix integration](https://www.zen.co.uk/large-business/products-solutions/cloud-hosting)\n  * Backup Consolidation\n\nI have been lucky enough to be involved with all of these ( some much more than others) Although the work is never complete Zen are in a good place.\n\nAt the same time, my personal circumstances have changed somewhat. My upcoming wedding and my fiancé not knowing exactly where she will be based meant having the freedom to be located anywhere (within reason) was a huge win for me.\n\nI was also looking for a role challenging me using some of the toolsets that I love but also being on the cutting edge of the various stacks.\n\nAnd with that – I am proud to say I am joining one of the big hitters, awarded both the EMEA and Global VMware Partner Innovation Award for professional services in 2018\n\nYes, I’m Joining [Xtravirt](https://xtravirt.com/) as a Senior Consultant.\n\nThis should allow me to utilize and improve my core VMware knowledge but also leverage some of my other skills including Veeam, Nutanix and AWS. Something I’m looking forward to. I also get to work with Chris Lewis, Simon Eady and one or two others…..\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Analytics in a privacy focused world](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/11/analytics-in-a-privacy-focused-world/)\n  * [Advanced Deploy VMware vSphere 7.x 3V0-22.21N](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/11/advanced-deploy-vmware-vsphere-7-x-3v0-22-21n/)\n  * [VMware &#8211; Going out with a Bang!](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/10/going-out-with-a-bang/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![My Home Office Setup & Upgrades](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_7017-scaled-1-768x576.jpeg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2021/01/my-home-office-setup-upgrades/)\n\n[Personal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/personal/) | [Consulting](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/consulting/)\n\n### [My Home Office Setup & Upgrades](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2021/01/my-home-office-setup-upgrades/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) January 5, 2021October 1, 2025\n\nGiven the year that was 2020 and at the time of writing a distinct improvement appears a long way off I decided it was time to up my homeworking game.
