One of the really cool features I wanted to mention today was the remediation script function. \n\nI have been playing with storage a lot in my lab recently as part of a wider storage migration piece but also as part of testing Intel Optane drives. Runecast flagged up that I didn’t have Storage I/O Control enabled for these data stores. It gave a great overview of what that issue means:\n\nIt is a good practice to enable SIOC, especially in environments where storage is overutilized. SIOC monitors the latency of I/Os to data stores at each ESX host sharing that device. When the average normalized datastore latency exceeds a set threshold (30ms by default), the datastore is considered to be congested, and SIOC kicks in to distribute the available storage resources to virtual machines in proportion to their shares. This is to ensure that low-priority workloads do not monopolize or reduce I/O bandwidth for high-priority workloads.\n\nBut the issue I want to highlight is it will generate the code to resolve it for you. \n\nIf I drill into the specific issue I get the below view\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-16-at-11.31.30-1024x536.png)\n\nHere you can confirm the discovered issue and the remediation action. ( I have chosen not to enable SIOC on my ISO-NFS datastore)\n\nThe below code is what Runecast generated for me.\n    \n    \n    # Automatically generated action. Always review before executing.\n    \n    # Start of the section for Enabling of Storage IO control on datastore\n    # This action is going to be performed on the following Datastores: \"Optane-iSCSI\"\n    \n    Write-Host \"`n[RCA] Connecting to vCenter Server \"uk-poo-p-vc-1.jameskilby.cloud\"...\" -ForegroundColor Cyan\n    $vcConnection = Connect-VIServer -Server \"uk-poo-p-vc-1.jameskilby.cloud\"\n    \n    $datastoreIds = \"Datastore-datastore-50097\"\n    \n    foreach($datastoreId in $datastoreIds) \n    {\n        try \n        {\n            $ds = Get-Datastore -Id $datastoreId -ErrorAction Stop\n            Write-Host \"`n[RCA] Reconfiguring datastore with current name $($ds.name)\" -ForegroundColor Yellow\n            Write-Host \"`n[RCA] Enabling Storage I/O Control\" -ForegroundColor Yellow\n            $ds | Set-Datastore -StorageIOControlEnabled $true -ErrorAction Stop | Format-Table name,Id,StorageIOControlEnabled\n            \n        }\n        catch \n        {\n            Write-Host \"`n[RCA] Datastore with ID $datastoreId was not found or the reconfiguration failed\" -ForegroundColor Red\n        }\n        \n    }\n    \n    Write-Host \"`n[RCA] Disconnecting from vCenter Server \"uk-poo-p-vc-1.jameskilby.cloud\"...\" -ForegroundColor Cyan\n    Disconnect-VIServer $vcConnection -Confirm:$false\n    \n    # End of the section for Enabling of Storage IO control on datastore\n\n📋 Copy\n\nDropping this into a PowerCLI session we get….\n    \n    \n    [RCA] Connecting to vCenter Server  uk-poo-p-vc-1.jameskilby.cloud...\n    \n    Specify Credential\n    Please specify server credential\n    User: administrator@vsphere.cloud\n    Password for user administrator@vsphere.cloud: ************\n    \n    \n    [RCA] Reconfiguring datastore with current name Optane-iSCSI\n    \n    [RCA] Enabling Storage I/O Control\n    \n    Name         Id                        StorageIOControlEnabled\n    ----         --                        -----------------------\n    Optane-iSCSI Datastore-datastore-50097                    True\n    \n    \n    [RCA] Disconnecting from vCenter Server  uk-poo-p-vc-1.jameskilby.cloud...\n    PS /Users/w20kilja> \n\n📋 Copy\n\nWhat an amazing little feature\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![An in-depth look at VMware Cloud on AWS hosts](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Picture-1-e1768509620339-768x193.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/08/vmc-host-deepdive/)\n\n[VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/) | [VMware Cloud on AWS](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/vmware-cloud-on-aws/)\n\n### [An in-depth look at VMware Cloud on AWS hosts](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/08/vmc-host-deepdive/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) August 14, 2025December 24, 2025\n\nThis is single page intended to collate every single feature of the current VMware Cloud on AWS hosts for easy comparison.
