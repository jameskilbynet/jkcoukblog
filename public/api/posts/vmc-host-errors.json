How you handle that can be a big differentiator. With VMware Cloud on AWS, the hosts are monitored 24×7 by VMware/AWS Support all as part of the service. If you pay for X number of hosts you should have X. That includes during maintenance and failure operations.\n\nI’m not sure lucky is the right word but I did witness a host issue with a customer I was working with. True to the marketing It was picked up and automatically remediated.\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2020-08-27-at-16.56.37-1536x182-2-1024x121.png)\n\nLooking at the log extract above a new host was being provisioned the same minute the issue was identified.
