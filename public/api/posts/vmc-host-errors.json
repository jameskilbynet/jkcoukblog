How you handle that can be a big differentiator. With VMware Cloud on AWS, the hosts are monitored 24×7 by VMware/AWS Support all as part of the service. If you pay for X number of hosts you should have X. That includes during maintenance and failure operations.\n\nI’m not sure lucky is the right word but I did witness a host issue with a customer I was working with. True to the marketing It was picked up and automatically remediated.\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2020-08-27-at-16.56.37-1536x182-2-1024x121.png)\n\nLooking at the log extract above a new host was being provisioned the same minute the issue was identified. Obviously, this needed to boot and join the VMware/vSAN cluster before a full data evacuation takes place on the faulty host and finally, the host is removed.\n\nAll of this was seamless to the customer. I noticed it as a few HA alarms tripped in the vCenter ( These were cosmetic only)\n\nJust another reason why you should look at the VMware Cloud on AWS Service\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Using Content Libraries in VMC to deploy software faster](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/01/using-content-libraries-in-vmc-to-deploy-software-faster/)\n  * [vSAN Cluster Shutdown &#8211; Orchestration](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/12/vsan-cluster-shutdown/)\n  * [An in-depth look at VMware Cloud on AWS hosts](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/08/vmc-host-deepdive/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/) | [Veeam](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/veeam/) | [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/)\n\n### [Lab Update – Desired Workloads](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/01/lab-update-part-5-desired-workloads/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) January 6, 2022November 11, 2023\n\nMy lab is always undergoing change.

I won’t go into any details of the contents but I will comment that I felt the questions were fair and that there wasn’t anything in it to trip you up. The required knowledge was certainly wider than the vSAN specialist exam.
