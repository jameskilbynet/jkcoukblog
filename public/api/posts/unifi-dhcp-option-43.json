This meant that new UniFi devices could not find the UniFi server for adoption/control purposes as this is usually done with broadcast.\n\n## Layer 3 Adoption Options\n\nFor Remote Adoption/Layer 3 UniFi supports:\n\n  * SSH\n  * DNS\n  * DHCP Option 43\n\nI discounted SSH as who wants to manually log into things and make changes and I discounted DNS. That left me with DHCP option 43\n\nI decided to configure my DHCP server to hand out “option 43” on the network subnet the Access Points were connected to. The implementation of this will differ depending on what DHCP server you are using. Mine is the one built into my WatchGuard Firebox M200.\n\nIn this, I have set a custom option and then it asks for four values:\n\nCode| 43  \n---|---  \nName | Unifi  \nType | Hexadecimal  \nValue | 01:04:c0:a8:14:02  \n  \nAll of which are straightforward except the last one so let me explain. It is made up of 2 parts\n\nThe first two parts 01:04 Is fixed for UniFi. I am hosting the controller on IP 192.168.20.2 The remaining part of the value (c0:a8:14:02) is the IP address of the UniFi controller in Hex. Please note this method does not support DNS.\n\nA multitude of tools exist for converting IP to HEX one can be found [here](https://www.browserling.com/tools/ip-to-hex)\n\nAnd there you have it. I can connect a factory fresh UniFi device to my network DHCP will hand out an IP on one subnet and tell the device how to reach the controller in a different subnet.\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Managing my Homelab with SemaphoreUI](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/09/managing-my-homelab-with-semaphoreui/)\n  * [Warp &#8211; The intelligent terminal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/04/warp-the-intelligent-terminal/)\n  * [Self Hosting AI Stack using vSphere, Docker and NVIDIA GPU](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/10/self-hosting-ai-stack-using-vsphere-docker-and-nvidia-gpu/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![Lab Storage](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/81-ZoEW24UL._SL1500_-768x461.jpg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2019/02/lab-storage-2/)\n\n[Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/)\n\n### [Lab Storage](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2019/02/lab-storage-2/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) February 10, 2019July 10, 2024\n\nLab Storage Update. Since starting my new role with Xtravirt my Homelab has gone through several fairly significant changes. At the moment it’s very much focused on the VMware stack and one of the things I needed was some more storage and especially some more storage performance. With that in mind, I purchased a new Synology…\n\n  * [ ![Starlink](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/spacexs-starlink-to-supply-free-satellite-internet-to-famili_u44u.1920-768x432.jpg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/10/starlink/)\n\n[Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/) | [Hosting](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/hosting/)\n\n### [Starlink](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/10/starlink/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) October 11, 2022October 1, 2025\n\nSince moving to Dorset last year internet connectivity has been the bane of my existence.

But technically it’s possible if I dropped all drive redundancy… I recently saw an advert for a server that was just too good to be true.
