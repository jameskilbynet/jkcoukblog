This meant that new UniFi devices could not find the UniFi server for adoption/control purposes as this is usually done with broadcast.\n\n## Layer 3 Adoption Options\n\nFor Remote Adoption/Layer 3 UniFi supports:\n\n  * SSH\n  * DNS\n  * DHCP Option 43\n\nI discounted SSH as who wants to manually log into things and make changes and I discounted DNS. That left me with DHCP option 43\n\nI decided to configure my DHCP server to hand out “option 43” on the network subnet the Access Points were connected to. The implementation of this will differ depending on what DHCP server you are using. Mine is the one built into my WatchGuard Firebox M200.\n\nIn this, I have set a custom option and then it asks for four values:\n\nCode| 43  \n---|---  \nName | Unifi  \nType | Hexadecimal  \nValue | 01:04:c0:a8:14:02  \n  \nAll of which are straightforward except the last one so let me explain. It is made up of 2 parts\n\nThe first two parts 01:04 Is fixed for UniFi. I am hosting the controller on IP 192.168.20.2 The remaining part of the value (c0:a8:14:02) is the IP address of the UniFi controller in Hex. Please note this method does not support DNS.\n\nA multitude of tools exist for converting IP to HEX one can be found [here](https://www.browserling.com/tools/ip-to-hex)\n\nAnd there you have it. I can connect a factory fresh UniFi device to my network DHCP will hand out an IP on one subnet and tell the device how to reach the controller in a different subnet.\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Automating the deployment of my Homelab AI Infrastructure](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/01/automating-the-deployment-of-my-ai-homelab-and-other-improvements/)\n  * [Managing my Homelab with SemaphoreUI](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/09/managing-my-homelab-with-semaphoreui/)\n  * [Warp &#8211; The intelligent terminal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/04/warp-the-intelligent-terminal/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![CRS-504](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/s-l1600-768x427.jpg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/09/home-network-upgrade/)\n\n[Mikrotik](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/mikrotik/) | [Networking](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/networking/)\n\n### [Home Network Upgrade](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/09/home-network-upgrade/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) September 9, 2024October 24, 2025\n\nMy journey to superfast networking in my homelab\n\n  * [ ![Nvidia Tesla P4 Homelab Setup](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_1107-768x403-1.jpg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/10/vgpu-setup-in-my-homelab/)\n\n[Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/) | [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/)\n\n### [Nvidia Tesla P4 Homelab Setup](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/10/vgpu-setup-in-my-homelab/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) October 23, 2023July 10, 2024\n\nA little while ago I decided to play with vGPU in my homelab.
