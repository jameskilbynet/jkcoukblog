I have had some great results with the current setup utilising a number of DAC’s but there were a couple of things that were annoying me. \n\nThen MikroTik dropped the [CRS504-4XQ-IN](https://mikrotik.com/product/crs504_4xq_in) and if the price wasn’t horrendous then that was the route I was going to go to alleviate these issues. Yes, it’s 100Gb/s and only has 4 ports but that should be all I need… I managed to locate one in stock for £587 plus Vat\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2157_hi_res-1024x462.png)\n\nAs you can see the switch has redundant power not often found at this price point. It actually has 4 ways to power it. 2 AC supplies, A DC input and then strangest of all it can be powered by POE in. This last point showcases how power efficient it is which is a huge win for a homelab.\n\nMy plan is to utilise the existing Intel 25Gb NICs I have and split the 100’s on the switch into 4×25. This technically gives me 16 usable 25 ports which are way more than I need. This will allow me to accommodate the TrueNAS box and the 2x Supermicro nodes I usually run for my lab. The other 2 nodes will get an upgrade at a future date. \n\nInitial impressions are that the switch is very quiet and also incredibly power efficient. ( It can be powered just from POE) however, the config is way more complex than I have seen before. This is because it’s basically a router that can switch at wire speed. The other challenge I have had is connecting my legacy 1gb/s network. This is still a work in progress but for now, Storage and vMotion have been migrated. \n\nI will report back when everything has been migrated.\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Automating the deployment of my Homelab AI Infrastructure](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/02/automating-the-deployment-of-my-ai-homelab-and-other-improvements/)\n  * [Managing my Homelab with SemaphoreUI](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/09/managing-my-homelab-with-semaphoreui/)\n  * [Warp &#8211; The intelligent terminal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/04/warp-the-intelligent-terminal/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![Lab Storage](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/81-ZoEW24UL._SL1500_-768x461.jpg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2019/02/lab-storage-2/)\n\n[Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/)\n\n### [Lab Storage](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2019/02/lab-storage-2/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) February 10, 2019July 10, 2024\n\nLab Storage Update.
