I won’t go into any details of the contents but I will comment that I felt the questions were fair and that there wasn’t anything in it to trip you up. The required knowledge was certainly wider than the vSAN specialist exam.\n\nThis was my third remote proctored exam and I must say the experience has improved. Partially that is down to Pearson Vue improving the process and partially down to knowing what to expect a bit better.\n\nTogether with the vSAN exam that I passed earlier in the month, this entitles me to a [VMware Master Services Competency](https://www.vmware.com/education-services/certification/vmware-ms-hci.html). This is now the second that I hold and I must say I like the way VMware is delivering a thought out learning path.\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Analytics in a privacy focused world](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/11/analytics-in-a-privacy-focused-world/)\n  * [Advanced Deploy VMware vSphere 7.x 3V0-22.21N](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/11/advanced-deploy-vmware-vsphere-7-x-3v0-22-21n/)\n  * [VMware &#8211; Going out with a Bang!](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/10/going-out-with-a-bang/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![VMC Quick Sizing Guide](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Picture-1-e1768509620339-768x193.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/05/vmc-quick-sizing-guide/)\n\n[VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/) | [VMware Cloud on AWS](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/vmware-cloud-on-aws/)\n\n### [VMC Quick Sizing Guide](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/05/vmc-quick-sizing-guide/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) May 21, 2025July 2, 2025\n\nQuick reference guide to the available storage resources that you get in VMware Cloud on AWS\n\n  * [ ![Nvidia Tesla P4 Homelab Setup](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_1107-768x403-1.jpg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/10/vgpu-setup-in-my-homelab/)\n\n[Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/) | [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/)\n\n### [Nvidia Tesla P4 Homelab Setup](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/10/vgpu-setup-in-my-homelab/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) October 23, 2023July 10, 2024\n\nA little while ago I decided to play with vGPU in my homelab.
