I won’t go into any details of the contents but I will comment that I felt the questions were fair and that there wasn’t anything in it to trip you up. The required knowledge was certainly wider than the vSAN specialist exam.\n\nThis was my third remote proctored exam and I must say the experience has improved. Partially that is down to Pearson Vue improving the process and partially down to knowing what to expect a bit better.\n\nTogether with the vSAN exam that I passed earlier in the month, this entitles me to a [VMware Master Services Competency](https://www.vmware.com/education-services/certification/vmware-ms-hci.html). This is now the second that I hold and I must say I like the way VMware is delivering a thought out learning path.\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Analytics in a privacy focused world](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/11/analytics-in-a-privacy-focused-world/)\n  * [Advanced Deploy VMware vSphere 7.x 3V0-22.21N](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/11/advanced-deploy-vmware-vsphere-7-x-3v0-22-21n/)\n  * [VMware &#8211; Going out with a Bang!](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/10/going-out-with-a-bang/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![And now for something completely different](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/fWbXybA7-768x193.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2018/10/and-now-for-something-completely-different/)\n\n[Personal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/personal/)\n\n### [And now for something completely different](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2018/10/and-now-for-something-completely-different/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) October 16, 2018July 10, 2024\n\nI have worked for my current employer Zen Internet for 3.5 years.

This is all due to the pending acquisition by Broadcom. There are a lot of unknowns for the staff and customers about what the company will look like in the future. I certainly have some concerns mainly just with the unknown.
