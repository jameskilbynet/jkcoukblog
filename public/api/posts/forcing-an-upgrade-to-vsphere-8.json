So with the release of vSphere 8 I was obviously going to upgrade however a few personal things blocked me from doing it until now. The vCenter upgrade was smooth however knowing that some of the hardware I am running is a little dated this was always going to carry a risk.\n\nI tried using lifecycle manager (vLCM) within vCenter but I was faced with the following and I couldn’t see a way to force remediate from within vCenter. Therefore I resorted to doing it from the command line.\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-14-at-21.24.32-1024x245.png)Host is not compatible\n\nFirstly enable SSH on each of the hosts to be upgraded\n\nThen Allow HTTP traffic in the ESXi firewall\n    \n    \n    esxcli network firewall ruleset set -e true -r httpClient\n\n📋 Copy\n\nThe next step is to list the available ESXi profiles using the online depot. In my case, I was looking for ESXi 8.0a\n    \n    \n    esxcli software sources profile list -d https://hostupdate.vmware.com/software/VUM/PRODUCTION/main/vmw-depot-index.xml | grep -i ESXi-8.0a\n\n📋 Copy\n\nThen comes the Install, I had validated that this would be ok by installing from USB to another node. All of the hardware that I needed continued to work as expected with the only significant loss being Mellanox Connect X-3 40Gb/s adaptor. \n    \n    \n    esxcli software profile update -p ESXi-8.0a-20842819-standard -d https://hostupdate.vmware.com/software/VUM/PRODUCTION/main/vmw-depot-index.xml --no-hardware-warning\n\n📋 Copy\n\nUpdate Result\n\nMessage: The update completed successfully, but the system needs to be rebooted for the changes to be effective. Reboot Required: true\n\nIt also listed all of the newly installed VIB’s \n\nThe last step is to disable the firewall rule and then SSH \n    \n    \n     esxcli network firewall ruleset set -e false -r httpClient\n\n📋 Copy\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Managing my Homelab with SemaphoreUI](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/09/managing-my-homelab-with-semaphoreui/)\n  * [Warp &#8211; The intelligent terminal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/04/warp-the-intelligent-terminal/)\n  * [Self Hosting AI Stack using vSphere, Docker and NVIDIA GPU](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/10/self-hosting-ai-stack-using-vsphere-docker-and-nvidia-gpu/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![VMC New Host -i3en](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/iu-1-768x395.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2020/07/i3en/)\n\n[VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/) | [VMware Cloud on AWS](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/vmware-cloud-on-aws/)\n\n### [VMC New Host -i3en](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2020/07/i3en/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) July 2, 2020July 10, 2024\n\nVMware Cloud on AWS (VMC) has introduced a new host to its lineup the “i3en”. This is based on the i3en.metal AWS instance. The specifications are certainly impressive packing in 96 logical cores, 768GiB RAM, and approximately 45.84 TiB of NVMe raw storage capacity per host.
