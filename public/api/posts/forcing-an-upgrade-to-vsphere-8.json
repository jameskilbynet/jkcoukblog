So with the release of vSphere 8 I was obviously going to upgrade however a few personal things blocked me from doing it until now. The vCenter upgrade was smooth however knowing that some of the hardware I am running is a little dated this was always going to carry a risk.\n\nI tried using lifecycle manager (vLCM) within vCenter but I was faced with the following and I couldn’t see a way to force remediate from within vCenter. Therefore I resorted to doing it from the command line.\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-14-at-21.24.32-1024x245.png)Host is not compatible\n\nFirstly enable SSH on each of the hosts to be upgraded\n\nThen Allow HTTP traffic in the ESXi firewall\n    \n    \n    esxcli network firewall ruleset set -e true -r httpClient\n\n📋 Copy\n\nThe next step is to list the available ESXi profiles using the online depot. In my case, I was looking for ESXi 8.0a\n    \n    \n    esxcli software sources profile list -d https://hostupdate.vmware.com/software/VUM/PRODUCTION/main/vmw-depot-index.xml | grep -i ESXi-8.0a\n\n📋 Copy\n\nThen comes the Install, I had validated that this would be ok by installing from USB to another node. All of the hardware that I needed continued to work as expected with the only significant loss being Mellanox Connect X-3 40Gb/s adaptor. \n    \n    \n    esxcli software profile update -p ESXi-8.0a-20842819-standard -d https://hostupdate.vmware.com/software/VUM/PRODUCTION/main/vmw-depot-index.xml --no-hardware-warning\n\n📋 Copy\n\nUpdate Result\n\nMessage: The update completed successfully, but the system needs to be rebooted for the changes to be effective. Reboot Required: true\n\nIt also listed all of the newly installed VIB’s \n\nThe last step is to disable the firewall rule and then SSH \n    \n    \n     esxcli network firewall ruleset set -e false -r httpClient\n\n📋 Copy\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Automating the deployment of my Homelab AI Infrastructure](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/01/automating-the-deployment-of-my-ai-homelab-and-other-improvements/)\n  * [Managing my Homelab with SemaphoreUI](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/09/managing-my-homelab-with-semaphoreui/)\n  * [Warp &#8211; The intelligent terminal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/04/warp-the-intelligent-terminal/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/) | [AWS](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/aws/) | [Veeam](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/veeam/)\n\n### [Monitoring VMC – Part 1](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2019/12/monitoring-vmc-part-1/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) December 17, 2019October 1, 2025\n\nAs previously mentioned I have been working a lot with VMware Cloud on AWS and one of the questions that often crops up is around an approach to monitoring. This is an interesting topic as VMC is technically “as a service” therefore the monitoring approach is a bit different.

However, due to the fairly high requirements, it didn’t make sense to me to continue running it at home. This was compounded by the fact that I have many clusters to play with at work. These all run my…\n\n  * [ ![Runecast Remediation Script’s](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Runecast-Solutions-Ltd.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/05/runecast-remediation-scripts/)\n\n[Runecast](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/runecast/) | [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/)\n\n### [Runecast Remediation Script’s](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/05/runecast-remediation-scripts/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) May 16, 2023November 17, 2023\n\nI am a huge fan of the Runecast product and luckily as a vExpert they give out NFR licences for my lab.
