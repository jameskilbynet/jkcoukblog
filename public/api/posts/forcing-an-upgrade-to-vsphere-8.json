So with the release of vSphere 8 I was obviously going to upgrade however a few personal things blocked me from doing it until now. The vCenter upgrade was smooth however knowing that some of the hardware I am running is a little dated this was always going to carry a risk.\n\nI tried using lifecycle manager (vLCM) within vCenter but I was faced with the following and I couldn’t see a way to force remediate from within vCenter. Therefore I resorted to doing it from the command line.\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-14-at-21.24.32-1024x245.png)Host is not compatible\n\nFirstly enable SSH on each of the hosts to be upgraded\n\nThen Allow HTTP traffic in the ESXi firewall\n    \n    \n    esxcli network firewall ruleset set -e true -r httpClient\n\n📋 Copy\n\nThe next step is to list the available ESXi profiles using the online depot. In my case, I was looking for ESXi 8.0a\n    \n    \n    esxcli software sources profile list -d https://hostupdate.vmware.com/software/VUM/PRODUCTION/main/vmw-depot-index.xml | grep -i ESXi-8.0a\n\n📋 Copy\n\nThen comes the Install, I had validated that this would be ok by installing from USB to another node. All of the hardware that I needed continued to work as expected with the only significant loss being Mellanox Connect X-3 40Gb/s adaptor. \n    \n    \n    esxcli software profile update -p ESXi-8.0a-20842819-standard -d https://hostupdate.vmware.com/software/VUM/PRODUCTION/main/vmw-depot-index.xml --no-hardware-warning\n\n📋 Copy\n\nUpdate Result\n\nMessage: The update completed successfully, but the system needs to be rebooted for the changes to be effective. Reboot Required: true\n\nIt also listed all of the newly installed VIB’s \n\nThe last step is to disable the firewall rule and then SSH \n    \n    \n     esxcli network firewall ruleset set -e false -r httpClient\n\n📋 Copy\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/) | [Storage](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/storage/) | [Synology](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/synology/)\n\n### [Lab Storage](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2018/01/lab-storage/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) January 6, 2018July 10, 2024\n\nI have been meaning to post around some of the lab setup for a while.
