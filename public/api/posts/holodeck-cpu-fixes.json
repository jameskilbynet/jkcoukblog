No support will be given for running cpu’s without the required feature sets.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\nIn my [previous post](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/01/multihost-holodeck-vcf/) about my Holodeck experience, I mentioned that I had some issues due to the age of the Physical CPU’s in the hosts that I was using to run Holodeck. This error will manifest itself in three places during the deployment.\n\n  * Nested ESX Power On\n  * vCLS machine deployment\n  * NSX Edge deployment\n\n## Nested ESX Power On\n\nObviously, my CPU’s are not supported for ESXi 8.0.1 and when the host is powered on you will see the image below. \n\n![ESXi unsupported error](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-27-at-12.55.09.png)\n\nJust like with a physical host, it is possible to override this. \n\nThis is done by adding \n    \n    \n    --ignoreprereqwarnings --ignoreprereqerrors --forceunsupportedinstall\n\n📋 Copy\n\nto the VLCGUI.ps1 script.\n\nFor the same reasons when the cluster is built and the vCLS VM’s for DRS are deployed, they will fail to power on. \n\n## NSX Edge\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-02-at-14.28.25.png)\n\nAnd last of all when the NSX edges attempt to power on they will fail due to the lack of a feature in the CPU called 1G huge page support. These issues can manifest when deploying NSX outside of VCF so a lot has been written about these issues and how to overcome them.\n\n## Solution\n\nLuckily a colleague of mine Tim Sommer has made all of the required changes to the VLCGUI.ps1 deployment script and that is available [here ](https://ent.box.com/s/u4wiwh2mq8o05ct8e67ndapvxhudkhe2)\n\nI have tried this multiple times and I have had a 100% success rate with the deployment with no manual fixes being required.\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![Nvidia Tesla P4 Homelab Setup](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_1107-768x403-1.jpg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/10/vgpu-setup-in-my-homelab/)\n\n[Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/) | [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/)\n\n### [Nvidia Tesla P4 Homelab Setup](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/10/vgpu-setup-in-my-homelab/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) October 23, 2023July 10, 2024\n\nA little while ago I decided to play with vGPU in my homelab.
