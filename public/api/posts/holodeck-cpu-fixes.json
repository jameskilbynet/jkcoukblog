No support will be given for running cpu’s without the required feature sets.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\nIn my [previous post](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/01/multihost-holodeck-vcf/) about my Holodeck experience, I mentioned that I had some issues due to the age of the Physical CPU’s in the hosts that I was using to run Holodeck. This error will manifest itself in three places during the deployment.\n\n  * Nested ESX Power On\n  * vCLS machine deployment\n  * NSX Edge deployment\n\n## Nested ESX Power On\n\nObviously, my CPU’s are not supported for ESXi 8.0.1 and when the host is powered on you will see the image below. \n\n![ESXi unsupported error](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-27-at-12.55.09.png)\n\nJust like with a physical host, it is possible to override this. \n\nThis is done by adding \n    \n    \n    --ignoreprereqwarnings --ignoreprereqerrors --forceunsupportedinstall\n\n📋 Copy\n\nto the VLCGUI.ps1 script.\n\nFor the same reasons when the cluster is built and the vCLS VM’s for DRS are deployed, they will fail to power on. \n\n## NSX Edge\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-02-at-14.28.25.png)\n\nAnd last of all when the NSX edges attempt to power on they will fail due to the lack of a feature in the CPU called 1G huge page support. These issues can manifest when deploying NSX outside of VCF so a lot has been written about these issues and how to overcome them.\n\n## Solution\n\nLuckily a colleague of mine Tim Sommer has made all of the required changes to the VLCGUI.ps1 deployment script and that is available [here ](https://ent.box.com/s/u4wiwh2mq8o05ct8e67ndapvxhudkhe2)\n\nI have tried this multiple times and I have had a 100% success rate with the deployment with no manual fixes being required.\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![Use Portainer in a Homelab with GitHub](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/22225832.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/12/use-portainer-in-a-homelab-with-github/)\n\n[Docker](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/docker/) | [Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/) | [Hosting](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/hosting/) | [Kubernetes](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/kubernetes/)\n\n### [Use Portainer in a Homelab with GitHub](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/12/use-portainer-in-a-homelab-with-github/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) December 9, 2022October 1, 2025\n\nLate to the party or not, I have been using containers in my lab more and more and that has led me to Portainer….

This is based on the i3en.metal AWS instance. The specifications are certainly impressive packing in 96 logical cores, 768GiB RAM, and approximately 45.84 TiB of NVMe raw storage capacity per host.

But technically it’s possible if I dropped all drive redundancy… I recently saw an advert for a server that was just too good to be true. It promised to bring a huge amount of storage and future options in a quite hard-to-believe 1U.
