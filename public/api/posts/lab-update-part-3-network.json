I will likely virtualise this in the future.\n\nIn terms of network/switching I have moved to an intermediate step here vMotion and Storage are running over DAC’s while VMware management and VM traffic is still over 1Gb/s networking. This is working incredibly well. Due to the onboard network cards I am able to vMotion at 40Gb/s which for a home lab is game-changing. Storage is currently over 25Gb/s and the long-term plan is to get a 25Gb/s switch. The contenders at the moment are a Used Dell enterprise switch or possibly a QNAP box.\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![Holodeck CPU Fixes](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/40oOd8IipPvtrPJs-1198788743-768x737.jpg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/01/holodeck-cpu-fixes/)\n\n[VCF](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/vcf/) | [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/)\n\n### [Holodeck CPU Fixes](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/01/holodeck-cpu-fixes/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) January 18, 2024July 10, 2024\n\nHow to deploy Holodeck with Legacy CPU’s\n\n  * [ ![Template Deployment with Packer](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/logo_packer.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2021/01/hashicorp-packer/)\n\n[Automation](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/automation/) | [Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/) | [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/)\n\n### [Template Deployment with Packer](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2021/01/hashicorp-packer/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) January 21, 2021December 8, 2025\n\nPacker is one of those tools I have heard about, and some of the cool people on Twitter that I follow have been using it for a while.
