I will likely virtualise this in the future.\n\nIn terms of network/switching I have moved to an intermediate step here vMotion and Storage are running over DAC’s while VMware management and VM traffic is still over 1Gb/s networking. This is working incredibly well. Due to the onboard network cards I am able to vMotion at 40Gb/s which for a home lab is game-changing. Storage is currently over 25Gb/s and the long-term plan is to get a 25Gb/s switch. The contenders at the moment are a Used Dell enterprise switch or possibly a QNAP box.\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Managing my Homelab with SemaphoreUI](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/09/managing-my-homelab-with-semaphoreui/)\n  * [Warp &#8211; The intelligent terminal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/04/warp-the-intelligent-terminal/)\n  * [Self Hosting AI Stack using vSphere, Docker and NVIDIA GPU](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/10/self-hosting-ai-stack-using-vsphere-docker-and-nvidia-gpu/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![Forcing an Upgrade to vSphere 8](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-14-at-21.45.23.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/12/forcing-an-upgrade-to-vsphere-8/)\n\n[Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/) | [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/) | [vSphere](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vsphere/)\n\n### [Forcing an Upgrade to vSphere 8](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/12/forcing-an-upgrade-to-vsphere-8/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) December 14, 2022October 1, 2025\n\nI run a reasonably extensive homelab that is of course built around the VMware ecosystem. So with the release of vSphere 8 I was obviously going to upgrade however a few personal things blocked me from doing it until now. The vCenter upgrade was smooth however knowing that some of the hardware I am running…\n\n  * [ ![Configuring a Zen Internet and City Fibre connection with a 3rd party router](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cityfibre-zen-768x403.jpg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/11/configuring-a-zen-internet-and-city-fibre-connection-with-a-3rd-party-router/)\n\n[Networking](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/networking/)\n\n### [Configuring a Zen Internet and City Fibre connection with a 3rd party router](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/11/configuring-a-zen-internet-and-city-fibre-connection-with-a-3rd-party-router/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) November 15, 2023January 18, 2026\n\nBack in July I bought a new house and one of the best things about the property was that it was already in a City Fibre location.

Since starting my new role with Xtravirt my Homelab has gone through several fairly significant changes. At the moment it’s very much focused on the VMware stack and one of the things I needed was some more storage and especially some more storage performance.
