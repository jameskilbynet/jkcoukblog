I will likely virtualise this in the future.\n\nIn terms of network/switching I have moved to an intermediate step here vMotion and Storage are running over DAC’s while VMware management and VM traffic is still over 1Gb/s networking. This is working incredibly well. Due to the onboard network cards I am able to vMotion at 40Gb/s which for a home lab is game-changing. Storage is currently over 25Gb/s and the long-term plan is to get a 25Gb/s switch. The contenders at the moment are a Used Dell enterprise switch or possibly a QNAP box.\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Automating the deployment of my Homelab AI Infrastructure](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/02/automating-the-deployment-of-my-ai-homelab-and-other-improvements/)\n  * [Managing my Homelab with SemaphoreUI](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/09/managing-my-homelab-with-semaphoreui/)\n  * [Warp &#8211; The intelligent terminal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/04/warp-the-intelligent-terminal/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![Nutanix CE](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nutanix-logo-HI-REZ_reverse-w-carrier-768x196.jpg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2018/01/nutanix-ce/)\n\n[Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/) | [Nutanix](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/nutanix/)\n\n### [Nutanix CE](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2018/01/nutanix-ce/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) January 6, 2018July 10, 2024\n\nI ran a Nutanix CE server at home for a little while when it first came out.
