I will likely virtualise this in the future.\n\nIn terms of network/switching I have moved to an intermediate step here vMotion and Storage are running over DAC’s while VMware management and VM traffic is still over 1Gb/s networking. This is working incredibly well. Due to the onboard network cards I am able to vMotion at 40Gb/s which for a home lab is game-changing. Storage is currently over 25Gb/s and the long-term plan is to get a 25Gb/s switch. The contenders at the moment are a Used Dell enterprise switch or possibly a QNAP box.\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Automating the deployment of my Homelab AI Infrastructure](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/01/automating-the-deployment-of-my-ai-homelab-and-other-improvements/)\n  * [Managing my Homelab with SemaphoreUI](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/09/managing-my-homelab-with-semaphoreui/)\n  * [Warp &#8211; The intelligent terminal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/04/warp-the-intelligent-terminal/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![Starlink](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/spacexs-starlink-to-supply-free-satellite-internet-to-famili_u44u.1920-768x432.jpg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/10/starlink/)\n\n[Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/) | [Hosting](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/hosting/)\n\n### [Starlink](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/10/starlink/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) October 11, 2022October 1, 2025\n\nSince moving to Dorset last year internet connectivity has been the bane of my existence.
