I will likely virtualise this in the future.\n\nIn terms of network/switching I have moved to an intermediate step here vMotion and Storage are running over DAC’s while VMware management and VM traffic is still over 1Gb/s networking. This is working incredibly well. Due to the onboard network cards I am able to vMotion at 40Gb/s which for a home lab is game-changing. Storage is currently over 25Gb/s and the long-term plan is to get a 25Gb/s switch. The contenders at the moment are a Used Dell enterprise switch or possibly a QNAP box.\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Automating the deployment of my Homelab AI Infrastructure](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/01/automating-the-deployment-of-my-ai-homelab-and-other-improvements/)\n  * [Managing my Homelab with SemaphoreUI](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/09/managing-my-homelab-with-semaphoreui/)\n  * [Warp &#8211; The intelligent terminal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/04/warp-the-intelligent-terminal/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![Configuring a Zen Internet and City Fibre connection with a 3rd party router](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cityfibre-zen-768x403.jpg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/11/configuring-a-zen-internet-and-city-fibre-connection-with-a-3rd-party-router/)\n\n[Networking](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/networking/)\n\n### [Configuring a Zen Internet and City Fibre connection with a 3rd party router](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/11/configuring-a-zen-internet-and-city-fibre-connection-with-a-3rd-party-router/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) November 15, 2023January 18, 2026\n\nBack in July I bought a new house and one of the best things about the property was that it was already in a City Fibre location.
