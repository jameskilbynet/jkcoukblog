While working with the following awesome project I noticed a couple of minor errors and Improvements that I wanted to suggest. I have worked in IT for over 10 years now but the opportunity to make suggestions to someone else’s codebase hadn’t popped up so I was keen to rectify that. Although I had used Git/GitHub before it was typically for my own uses as a code storage location. I, therefore, needed to sanity check the process of a “pull request” so off to YouTube I went.\n\nThe above video seemed to clarify the process the best and with that knowledge, the request was submitted to the owners and luckily it was accepted.\n\nYou can see that I am now listed as a contributor [here](https://github.com/rainpole/packer-vsphere/graphs/contributors). Although my contribution was tiny, now that I understand the process much better I am planning to contribute some more to what is a fantastic little project.\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![AWS Solution Architect – Associate](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/AmazonWebservices_Logo.svg_-768x307.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2019/12/aws-solution-architect-associate/)\n\n[AWS](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/aws/) | [Personal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/personal/)\n\n### [AWS Solution Architect – Associate](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2019/12/aws-solution-architect-associate/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) December 16, 2019December 4, 2025\n\nToday was a good day.
