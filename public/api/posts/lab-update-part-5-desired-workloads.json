But technically it’s possible if I dropped all drive redundancy… I recently saw an advert for a server that was just too good to be true. It promised to bring a huge amount of storage and future options in a quite hard-to-believe 1U.

It’s easy to deploy in Docker, and I am slowly moving more of my homelab management over to it.
