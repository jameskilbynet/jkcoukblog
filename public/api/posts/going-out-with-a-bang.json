This is all due to the pending acquisition by Broadcom. There are a lot of unknowns for the staff and customers about what the company will look like in the future. I certainly have some concerns mainly just with the unknown. However, VMware has a great reputation for doing the right thing around its staff, customers, and the wider world. \n\nYesterday the entire company was off on one of VMware’s so-called [EPIC](https://news.vmware.com/company/vmwares-culture-built-epic2-values) days. I spent the day with my family on the beach. \n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_3745-768x1024.jpeg)\n\nVMware also gave all employees $1300 dollars for donation through their foundation to a charity of your choice. I decided to give mine to the [RNLI](https://rnli.org). Being based in Poole for the last couple of years and having a friend who volunteers for the RNLI in Ireland, I thought they were a great recipient of this very generous donation from VMware. \n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-09-22-at-15.07.27.png)\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Automating the deployment of my Homelab AI Infrastructure](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/02/automating-the-deployment-of-my-ai-homelab-and-other-improvements/)\n  * [Using Content Libraries in VMC to deploy software faster](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/01/using-content-libraries-in-vmc-to-deploy-software-faster/)\n  * [vSAN Cluster Shutdown &#8211; Orchestration](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/12/vsan-cluster-shutdown/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![Time in a VMC Environment](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Picture-1-e1768509620339-768x193.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/12/time-in-a-vmc-environment/)\n\n[VMware Cloud on AWS](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/vmware-cloud-on-aws/)\n\n### [Time in a VMC Environment](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/12/time-in-a-vmc-environment/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) December 8, 2025February 1, 2026\n\nHow to use the Amazon Time Sync Service in a VMC environment\n\n  * [ ![vSAN Cluster Shutdown – Orchestration](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/OrigionalPoweredByvSAN-550x324-1.jpg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/12/vsan-cluster-shutdown/)\n\n[VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/) | [vSAN](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/vsan-vmware/)\n\n### [vSAN Cluster Shutdown – Orchestration](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/12/vsan-cluster-shutdown/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) December 6, 2025February 1, 2026\n\nHow to safety shutdown a vSAN Environment\n\n  * [ ![My Home Office Setup & Upgrades](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_7017-scaled-1-768x576.jpeg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2021/01/my-home-office-setup-upgrades/)\n\n[Personal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/personal/) | [Consulting](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/consulting/)\n\n### [My Home Office Setup & Upgrades](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2021/01/my-home-office-setup-upgrades/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) January 5, 2021October 1, 2025\n\nGiven the year that was 2020 and at the time of writing a distinct improvement appears a long way off I decided it was time to up my homeworking game. I bought a beautiful Dell 49″ monitor back in mid-2020 that has been the central focus of my home office.

This is an interesting topic as VMC is technically “as a service” therefore the monitoring approach is a bit different.
