This is all due to the pending acquisition by Broadcom. There are a lot of unknowns for the staff and customers about what the company will look like in the future. I certainly have some concerns mainly just with the unknown. However, VMware has a great reputation for doing the right thing around its staff, customers, and the wider world. \n\nYesterday the entire company was off on one of VMware’s so-called [EPIC](https://news.vmware.com/company/vmwares-culture-built-epic2-values) days. I spent the day with my family on the beach. \n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_3745-768x1024.jpeg)\n\nVMware also gave all employees $1300 dollars for donation through their foundation to a charity of your choice. I decided to give mine to the [RNLI](https://rnli.org). Being based in Poole for the last couple of years and having a friend who volunteers for the RNLI in Ireland, I thought they were a great recipient of this very generous donation from VMware. \n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-09-22-at-15.07.27.png)\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Automating the deployment of my Homelab AI Infrastructure](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/02/automating-the-deployment-of-my-ai-homelab-and-other-improvements/)\n  * [Using Content Libraries in VMC to deploy software faster](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/01/using-content-libraries-in-vmc-to-deploy-software-faster/)\n  * [vSAN Cluster Shutdown &#8211; Orchestration](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/12/vsan-cluster-shutdown/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![And now for something completely different](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/fWbXybA7-768x193.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2018/10/and-now-for-something-completely-different/)\n\n[Personal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/personal/)\n\n### [And now for something completely different](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2018/10/and-now-for-something-completely-different/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) October 16, 2018July 10, 2024\n\nI have worked for my current employer Zen Internet for 3.5 years. Over that time I have changed roles from what was originally a customer-focused role into a role with one of the core platform teams. This has meant looking after the majority of the Internal and customer Virtual platforms.

I don’t think it’s an understatement to say I probably wouldn’t have my current role within VMware without it.
