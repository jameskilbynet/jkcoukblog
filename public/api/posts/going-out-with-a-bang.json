This is all due to the pending acquisition by Broadcom. There are a lot of unknowns for the staff and customers about what the company will look like in the future. I certainly have some concerns mainly just with the unknown. However, VMware has a great reputation for doing the right thing around its staff, customers, and the wider world. \n\nYesterday the entire company was off on one of VMware’s so-called [EPIC](https://news.vmware.com/company/vmwares-culture-built-epic2-values) days. I spent the day with my family on the beach. \n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_3745-768x1024.jpeg)\n\nVMware also gave all employees $1300 dollars for donation through their foundation to a charity of your choice. I decided to give mine to the [RNLI](https://rnli.org). Being based in Poole for the last couple of years and having a friend who volunteers for the RNLI in Ireland, I thought they were a great recipient of this very generous donation from VMware. \n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-09-22-at-15.07.27.png)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![vSAN Cluster Shutdown – Orchestration](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/OrigionalPoweredByvSAN-550x324-1.jpg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/12/vsan-cluster-shutdown/)\n\n[VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/) | [vSAN](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/vsan-vmware/)\n\n### [vSAN Cluster Shutdown – Orchestration](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/12/vsan-cluster-shutdown/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) December 6, 2025January 17, 2026\n\nHow to safety shutdown a vSAN Environment\n\n  * [ ![Forcing an Upgrade to vSphere 8](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-14-at-21.45.23.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/12/forcing-an-upgrade-to-vsphere-8/)\n\n[Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/) | [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/) | [vSphere](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vsphere/)\n\n### [Forcing an Upgrade to vSphere 8](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/12/forcing-an-upgrade-to-vsphere-8/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) December 14, 2022October 1, 2025\n\nI run a reasonably extensive homelab that is of course built around the VMware ecosystem. So with the release of vSphere 8 I was obviously going to upgrade however a few personal things blocked me from doing it until now. The vCenter upgrade was smooth however knowing that some of the hardware I am running…\n\n  * [ ![Using Content Libraries in VMC to deploy software faster](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Firefly_Gemini-Flash-768x417.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/01/using-content-libraries-in-vmc-to-deploy-software-faster/)\n\n[VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/) | [VMware Cloud on AWS](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/vmware-cloud-on-aws/)\n\n### [Using Content Libraries in VMC to deploy software faster](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/01/using-content-libraries-in-vmc-to-deploy-software-faster/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) January 27, 2026January 27, 2026\n\nHow to leverage Content Libraries to deploy into VMware Cloud on AWS faster.\n\n  * [ ![VMware Certified Master Specialist HCI 2020](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vmware_SP_HCI20.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2020/09/vmware-certified-master-specialist-hci-2020/)\n\n[Personal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/personal/) | [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/)\n\n### [VMware Certified Master Specialist HCI 2020](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2020/09/vmware-certified-master-specialist-hci-2020/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) September 13, 2020November 11, 2023\n\nI recently sat (and passed the VMware HCI Master Specialist exam (5V0-21.20).
