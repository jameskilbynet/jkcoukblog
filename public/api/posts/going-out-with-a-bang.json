This is all due to the pending acquisition by Broadcom. There are a lot of unknowns for the staff and customers about what the company will look like in the future. I certainly have some concerns mainly just with the unknown. However, VMware has a great reputation for doing the right thing around its staff, customers, and the wider world. \n\nYesterday the entire company was off on one of VMware’s so-called [EPIC](https://news.vmware.com/company/vmwares-culture-built-epic2-values) days. I spent the day with my family on the beach. \n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_3745-768x1024.jpeg)\n\nVMware also gave all employees $1300 dollars for donation through their foundation to a charity of your choice. I decided to give mine to the [RNLI](https://rnli.org). Being based in Poole for the last couple of years and having a friend who volunteers for the RNLI in Ireland, I thought they were a great recipient of this very generous donation from VMware. \n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-09-22-at-15.07.27.png)\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Automating the deployment of my Homelab AI Infrastructure](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/02/automating-the-deployment-of-my-ai-homelab-and-other-improvements/)\n  * [Using Content Libraries in VMC to deploy software faster](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/01/using-content-libraries-in-vmc-to-deploy-software-faster/)\n  * [vSAN Cluster Shutdown &#8211; Orchestration](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/12/vsan-cluster-shutdown/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![VMC – vSAN ESA](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/OrigionalPoweredByvSAN-550x324-1.jpg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/11/vsan-esa-and-the-improvements-it-brings-to-vmc/)\n\n[VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/) | [VMware Cloud on AWS](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/vmware-cloud-on-aws/) | [vSAN](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/vsan-vmware/)\n\n### [VMC – vSAN ESA](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/11/vsan-esa-and-the-improvements-it-brings-to-vmc/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) November 17, 2023July 10, 2024\n\nAn Overview of vSAN ESA in VMC \n\n  * [ ![Using Content Libraries in VMC to deploy software faster](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Firefly_Gemini-Flash-768x417.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/01/using-content-libraries-in-vmc-to-deploy-software-faster/)\n\n[VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/) | [VMware Cloud on AWS](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/vmware-cloud-on-aws/)\n\n### [Using Content Libraries in VMC to deploy software faster](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/01/using-content-libraries-in-vmc-to-deploy-software-faster/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) January 27, 2026February 1, 2026\n\nHow to leverage Content Libraries to deploy into VMware Cloud on AWS faster.\n\n  * [ ![Nvidia Tesla P4 Homelab Setup](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_1107-768x403-1.jpg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/10/vgpu-setup-in-my-homelab/)\n\n[Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/) | [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/)\n\n### [Nvidia Tesla P4 Homelab Setup](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/10/vgpu-setup-in-my-homelab/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) October 23, 2023July 10, 2024\n\nA little while ago I decided to play with vGPU in my homelab. This was something I had dabbled with in the past but never really had the time or need to get working properly. The first thing that I needed was a GPU. I did have a Dell T20 with an iGPU built into…\n\n  * [ ![Analytics in a privacy focused world](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/plausible-analytics-icon-top.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/11/analytics-in-a-privacy-focused-world/)\n\n[Hosting](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/hosting/) | [Personal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/personal/)\n\n### [Analytics in a privacy focused world](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/11/analytics-in-a-privacy-focused-world/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) November 10, 2023October 1, 2025\n\nI recently helped my friend Dean Lewis @veducate with some hosting issues.
