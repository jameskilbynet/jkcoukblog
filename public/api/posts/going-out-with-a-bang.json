This is all due to the pending acquisition by Broadcom. There are a lot of unknowns for the staff and customers about what the company will look like in the future. I certainly have some concerns mainly just with the unknown. However, VMware has a great reputation for doing the right thing around its staff, customers, and the wider world. \n\nYesterday the entire company was off on one of VMware’s so-called [EPIC](https://news.vmware.com/company/vmwares-culture-built-epic2-values) days. I spent the day with my family on the beach. \n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_3745-768x1024.jpeg)\n\nVMware also gave all employees $1300 dollars for donation through their foundation to a charity of your choice. I decided to give mine to the [RNLI](https://rnli.org). Being based in Poole for the last couple of years and having a friend who volunteers for the RNLI in Ireland, I thought they were a great recipient of this very generous donation from VMware. \n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-09-22-at-15.07.27.png)\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Using Content Libraries in VMC to deploy software faster](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/01/using-content-libraries-in-vmc-to-deploy-software-faster/)\n  * [vSAN Cluster Shutdown &#8211; Orchestration](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/12/vsan-cluster-shutdown/)\n  * [An in-depth look at VMware Cloud on AWS hosts](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/08/vmc-host-deepdive/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/) | [AWS](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/aws/) | [Veeam](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/veeam/)\n\n### [Monitoring VMC – Part 1](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2019/12/monitoring-vmc-part-1/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) December 17, 2019October 1, 2025\n\nAs previously mentioned I have been working a lot with VMware Cloud on AWS and one of the questions that often crops up is around an approach to monitoring. This is an interesting topic as VMC is technically “as a service” therefore the monitoring approach is a bit different.

One of those is Time…. A key requirement for any enterprise platform.
