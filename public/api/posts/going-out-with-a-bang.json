This is all due to the pending acquisition by Broadcom. There are a lot of unknowns for the staff and customers about what the company will look like in the future. I certainly have some concerns mainly just with the unknown. However, VMware has a great reputation for doing the right thing around its staff, customers, and the wider world. \n\nYesterday the entire company was off on one of VMware’s so-called [EPIC](https://news.vmware.com/company/vmwares-culture-built-epic2-values) days. I spent the day with my family on the beach. \n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_3745-768x1024.jpeg)\n\nVMware also gave all employees $1300 dollars for donation through their foundation to a charity of your choice. I decided to give mine to the [RNLI](https://rnli.org). Being based in Poole for the last couple of years and having a friend who volunteers for the RNLI in Ireland, I thought they were a great recipient of this very generous donation from VMware. \n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-09-22-at-15.07.27.png)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![Using Content Libraries in VMC to deploy software faster](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Firefly_Gemini-Flash-768x417.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/01/using-content-libraries-in-vmc-to-deploy-software-faster/)\n\n[VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/) | [VMware Cloud on AWS](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/vmware-cloud-on-aws/)\n\n### [Using Content Libraries in VMC to deploy software faster](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/01/using-content-libraries-in-vmc-to-deploy-software-faster/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) January 27, 2026January 30, 2026\n\nHow to leverage Content Libraries to deploy into VMware Cloud on AWS faster.\n\n  * [ ![Nutanix NCP](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nutanix-logo-HI-REZ_reverse-w-carrier-768x196.jpg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2020/07/nutanix-ncp/)\n\n[Nutanix](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/nutanix/) | [Personal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/personal/)\n\n### [Nutanix NCP](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2020/07/nutanix-ncp/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) July 2, 2020July 10, 2024\n\nI saw a tweet a couple of weeks ago mentioning that Nutanix were offering a free go at the Nutanix Certified Professional exam.

So with the release of vSphere 8 I was obviously going to upgrade however a few personal things blocked me from doing it until now. The vCenter upgrade was smooth however knowing that some of the hardware I am running…\n\n  * [ ![Time in a VMC Environment](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Picture-1-e1768509620339-768x193.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/12/time-in-a-vmc-environment/)\n\n[VMware Cloud on AWS](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/vmware-cloud-on-aws/)\n\n### [Time in a VMC Environment](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/12/time-in-a-vmc-environment/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) December 8, 2025January 17, 2026\n\nOne of the nice things about the VMC Service is that you dont have to worry about a number of the traditional infrastructure services that you typically obsess over when your running your own infrastructure. One of those is Time…. A key requirement for any enterprise platform. Time VMC allows you to utilise the Amazon…\n\n  * [ ![My First Pull](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/175jvBleoQfAZJc3sgTSPQA.jpg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2020/12/my-first-pull/)\n\n[Devops](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/devops/) | [Personal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/personal/)\n\n### [My First Pull](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2020/12/my-first-pull/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) December 22, 2020December 8, 2025\n\nI was initially going to add in the contents of this post to one that I have been writing about my exploits with HashiCorp Packer but I decided it probably warranted being separated out.
