This is all due to the pending acquisition by Broadcom. There are a lot of unknowns for the staff and customers about what the company will look like in the future. I certainly have some concerns mainly just with the unknown. However, VMware has a great reputation for doing the right thing around its staff, customers, and the wider world. \n\nYesterday the entire company was off on one of VMware’s so-called [EPIC](https://news.vmware.com/company/vmwares-culture-built-epic2-values) days. I spent the day with my family on the beach. \n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_3745-768x1024.jpeg)\n\nVMware also gave all employees $1300 dollars for donation through their foundation to a charity of your choice. I decided to give mine to the [RNLI](https://rnli.org). Being based in Poole for the last couple of years and having a friend who volunteers for the RNLI in Ireland, I thought they were a great recipient of this very generous donation from VMware. \n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-09-22-at-15.07.27.png)\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Using Content Libraries in VMC to deploy software faster](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/01/using-content-libraries-in-vmc-to-deploy-software-faster/)\n  * [vSAN Cluster Shutdown &#8211; Orchestration](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/12/vsan-cluster-shutdown/)\n  * [An in-depth look at VMware Cloud on AWS hosts](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/08/vmc-host-deepdive/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![Web Development](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/iu-2-768x229.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/01/web-development/)\n\n[Hosting](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/hosting/) | [Cloudflare](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/cloudflare/) | [Personal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/personal/) | [Wordpress](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/wordpress/)\n\n### [Web Development](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/01/web-development/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) January 4, 2022October 1, 2025\n\nA while ago I started messing with Cloudflare Workers.
