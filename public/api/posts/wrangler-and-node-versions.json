Until today…\n\nI went to push some changes to this site and got the following error message\n    \n    \n    wrangler publish --env production\n    /usr/local/bin/node: bad option: --openssl-legacy-provider\n    Error: failed to execute `\"/usr/local/bin/node\" \"--openssl-legacy-provider\" \"/Users/jameskilby/Library/Caches/.wrangler/wranglerjs-1.19.6\" \"--output-file=/var/folders/89/z9t99sg16h9cw3t86wp920jr0000gn/T/.wranglerjs_outputGBCY9\" \"--wasm-binding=WASM_MODULE\" \"--no-webpack-config=1\" \"--use-entry=/Users/jameskilby/jameskilbycouk/workers-site/index.js\"`: exited with exit status: 9\n\n📋 Copy\n\nA quick bit of digging and it turns out the error was due to a new version of node being used (Version 17) \n\nThe brew search command showed that I still had node16 installed \n    \n    \n    brew search node  \n    ==> Formulae\n    libbitcoin-node             node ✔                      node-sass                   node@12                     node@16 ✔                   nodebrew                    nodenv\n    llnode                      node-build                  node@10                     node@14                     node_exporter               nodeenv                     ode\n\n📋 Copy\n\nSo I then removed the link to the generic node and forced the link to node@16\n    \n    \n    brew unlink node\n    \n    brew link --overwrite node@16\n\n📋 Copy\n\nOnce this was done wrangler worked as expected and published my changes\n    \n    \n    rangler publish --env production\n    ✨  Built successfully, built project size is 13 KiB.\n    🌀  Using namespace for Workers Site \"__jameskilbycouk-production-workers_sites_assets\"\n    ✨  Success\n    🌀  Uploading site files\n    \n\n📋 Copy\n\nCertainly not a complex fix but hopefully handy for anyone playing with Wrangler on a Mac and using homebrew.\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Web Development Improvements](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/01/web-development-improvements/)\n  * [How I upgraded my blog as a Static Website with GitHub Actions and Cloudflare](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/10/how-i-deploy-my-blog-as-a-static-website-with-github-actions-and-cloudflare/)\n  * [WordPress Hosting with Cloudflare Pages](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/05/how-to-take-a-wordpress-site-and-publish-it-as-a-static-site-on-cloudflare-pages/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![Static WordPress hosting using Cloudflare](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/iu-768x450.jpeg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/10/how-i-moved-my-wordpress-site-to-cloudflare-pages/)\n\n[Cloudflare](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/cloudflare/) | [Hosting](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/hosting/) | [Wordpress](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/wordpress/)\n\n### [Static WordPress hosting using Cloudflare](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/10/how-i-moved-my-wordpress-site-to-cloudflare-pages/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) October 20, 2022February 9, 2026\n\nFor a while now I have been running this site directly from Cloudflare utilising their excellent worker’s product.
