You can view complete usage information in the dashboard._\n\n_If you do not take any action and exceed the daily limit, requests to the Workers KV API will return 429 errors, and operations within a worker will fail until the limit resets at 2022-01-05 at 00:00:00 UTC._\n\nI decided to keep ploughing on with my changes to see what happens when I go over this.\n\nThe next email I received was slightly more informative as it said which limit I had breached.\n\n_You have exceeded the daily Cloudflare Workers KV free tier limit of 1000 Workers KV put operations._\n\nWhen I next tried to publish I got the following \n    \n    \n    wrangler publish --env production\n    ✨  Built successfully, built project size is 13 KiB.\n    🌀  Using namespace for Workers Site \"__jameskilbycouk-production-workers_sites_assets\"\n    ✨  Success\n    🌀  Uploading site files\n    Error: ⚠️  Code 10048: your account has reached the free usage limit for this operation for today\n\n📋 Copy\n\nThe same error was observed when running “Wrangler dev”\n\nI had the option of upgrading for the cost of $5 which includes a very generous 10 million read operations and 1 million each of write, delete and list operations however it’s just not worth it for this site. I will wait until tomorrow to publish.\n\nDetailed info on the limits is published [here ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits)\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Web Development Improvements](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/01/web-development-improvements/)\n  * [How I Migrated from Pocket to Hoarder with AI Integration](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/01/how-i-migrated-from-pocket-to-hoarder-and-introduced-some-ai-along-the-way/)\n  * [Analytics in a privacy focused world](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/11/analytics-in-a-privacy-focused-world/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![Use Portainer in a Homelab with GitHub](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/22225832.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/12/use-portainer-in-a-homelab-with-github/)\n\n[Docker](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/docker/) | [Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/) | [Hosting](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/hosting/) | [Kubernetes](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/kubernetes/)\n\n### [Use Portainer in a Homelab with GitHub](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/12/use-portainer-in-a-homelab-with-github/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) December 9, 2022October 1, 2025\n\nLate to the party or not, I have been using containers in my lab more and more and that has led me to Portainer….
