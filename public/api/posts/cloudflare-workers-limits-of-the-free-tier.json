You can view complete usage information in the dashboard._\n\n_If you do not take any action and exceed the daily limit, requests to the Workers KV API will return 429 errors, and operations within a worker will fail until the limit resets at 2022-01-05 at 00:00:00 UTC._\n\nI decided to keep ploughing on with my changes to see what happens when I go over this.\n\nThe next email I received was slightly more informative as it said which limit I had breached.\n\n_You have exceeded the daily Cloudflare Workers KV free tier limit of 1000 Workers KV put operations._\n\nWhen I next tried to publish I got the following \n    \n    \n    wrangler publish --env production\n    ✨  Built successfully, built project size is 13 KiB.\n    🌀  Using namespace for Workers Site \"__jameskilbycouk-production-workers_sites_assets\"\n    ✨  Success\n    🌀  Uploading site files\n    Error: ⚠️  Code 10048: your account has reached the free usage limit for this operation for today\n\n📋 Copy\n\nThe same error was observed when running “Wrangler dev”\n\nI had the option of upgrading for the cost of $5 which includes a very generous 10 million read operations and 1 million each of write, delete and list operations however it’s just not worth it for this site. I will wait until tomorrow to publish.\n\nDetailed info on the limits is published [here ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![Wrangler and Node versions](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WranglerCrab-1-768x256.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/01/wrangler-and-node-versions/)\n\n[Cloudflare](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/cloudflare/)\n\n### [Wrangler and Node versions](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/01/wrangler-and-node-versions/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) January 15, 2022April 10, 2023\n\nI am a massive fan of the brew package management system for macOS and use it on all of my Mac’s I typically just upgrade everything blindly and have never had an issue…..
