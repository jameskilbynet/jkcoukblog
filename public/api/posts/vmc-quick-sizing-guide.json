So with the release of vSphere 8 I was obviously going to upgrade however a few personal things blocked me from doing it until now. The vCenter upgrade was smooth however knowing that some of the hardware I am running…\n\n  * [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/) | [AWS](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/aws/) | [Veeam](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/veeam/)\n\n### [Monitoring VMC – Part 1](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2019/12/monitoring-vmc-part-1/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) December 17, 2019October 1, 2025\n\nAs previously mentioned I have been working a lot with VMware Cloud on AWS and one of the questions that often crops up is around an approach to monitoring. This is an interesting topic as VMC is technically “as a service” therefore the monitoring approach is a bit different. Technically AWS and VMware’s SRE teams…\n\n  * [ ![VMware Certified Master Specialist HCI 2020](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vmware_SP_HCI20.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2020/09/vmware-certified-master-specialist-hci-2020/)\n\n[Personal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/personal/) | [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/)\n\n### [VMware Certified Master Specialist HCI 2020](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2020/09/vmware-certified-master-specialist-hci-2020/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) September 13, 2020November 11, 2023\n\nI recently sat (and passed the VMware HCI Master Specialist exam (5V0-21.20). I won’t go into any details of the contents but I will comment that I felt the questions were fair and that there wasn’t anything in it to trip you up. The required knowledge was certainly wider than the vSAN specialist exam.

This is all due to the pending acquisition by Broadcom. There are a lot of unknowns for the staff and customers about what the company will look like in the future. I certainly have some concerns mainly just with the unknown.
