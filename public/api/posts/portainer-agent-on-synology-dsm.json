I wanted to extend this management to one of my Synology NAS devices as I had plans to run a few containers on them (away from my main VMware Cluster) At present Portainer runs in a Docker VM direct on my [TrueNAS](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/09/can-you-really-squeeze-96tb-in-1u/) box\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n## Setup\n\nWhen logged into Portainer, the first thing we are going to do is add another environment. This is done by navigating to the environments section. I am lucky enough to have a 5 node Business licence for this purpose.\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/portainer-environments.png)\n\nThis will navigate you to the list of existing environments, where you can add an additional environment\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/environment-List-1024x166.png)\n\nThe wizard will then ask you what environment you would like to create. In my case it will be a Docker Standalone\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/environment-Type-1024x301.png)\n\nOnce you have chosen Docker you have to name the environment and tell Portainer the address remembering the port (9001)\n\nPortainer then gives you the command to execute on the remote environment to fire up the Portainer Agent for the Portainer server to connect to.\n\n## Issue\n\nWhen I SSH into my Synology to run the commands I get the below error\n    \n    \n     sudo docker run -d \\\n    >   -p 9001:9001 \\\n    >   --name portainer_agent \\\n    >   --restart=always \\\n    >   -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\\n    >   -v /var/lib/docker/volumes:/var/lib/docker/volumes \\\n    >   -v /:/host \\\n    >   portainer/agent:2.27.1\n    \n    We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System\n    Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:\n    \n        #1) Respect the privacy of others.\n        #2) Think before you type.\n        #3) With great power comes great responsibility.\n    \n    Password: \n    Unable to find image 'portainer/agent:2.27.1' locally\n    2.27.1: Pulling from portainer/agent\n    436768c74267: Pull complete \n    d61825c69234: Pull complete \n    51403bd1b0cb: Pull complete \n    1eb0f77f2186: Pull complete \n    285795d2a093: Pull complete \n    cccbadf68541: Pull complete \n    3dd836c679e8: Pull complete \n    9da95a675496: Pull complete \n    92100a91b378: Pull complete \n    Digest: sha256:d2e6833bb6f067962f79be262066cc96921159bc9a49a3100cacecb542522fd5\n    Status: Downloaded newer image for portainer/agent:2.27.1\n    2a0dcdc5b104c35b0b030da973d7f7a6a148c24aa50db35e9ecf49dc0279fd03\n    **docker: Error response from daemon: Bind mount failed: '/var/lib/docker/volumes' does not exist.**\n\n📋 Copy\n\n## The Fix\n\nThis occurs as /var/lib/docker/volumes does not exist on the Synology Filesystem.
