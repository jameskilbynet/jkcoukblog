This is known as a BigTwin configuration in SuperMicro parlance. This is something I was very familiar with as most of the Nutanix nodes that we deployed at Zen were of this design.\n\nEach node has 2x Intel Xeon CPU E5-2670 @ 2.60GHz 3 Nodes have 192GB of RAM and 1 has 128GB giving a combined 64c/128t and 704GB of RAM. Quite an amount to be squeezed into 2U.\n\nThis is a huge uplift in compute resources so is more than welcome. I also decided to put what I could in a proper rack and purchased a Startech 25U rack to mount it.\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_4536-scaled-1-768x1024.jpg) One of the Compute nodes was removed from the server\n\nThe plan is also to make a serious network investment (to move me away from 1Gb) but I haven’t completely decided what that will look like. This will likely be the final investment for a while.\n\nWith the additional Supermicro compute available I have made the Z840 a sort of standalone node. I will keep it around as it’s the only thing capable of running my Nvidia K2. \n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![Holodeck CPU Fixes](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/40oOd8IipPvtrPJs-1198788743-768x737.jpg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/01/holodeck-cpu-fixes/)\n\n[VCF](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/vcf/) | [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/)\n\n### [Holodeck CPU Fixes](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/01/holodeck-cpu-fixes/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) January 18, 2024July 10, 2024\n\nHow to deploy Holodeck with Legacy CPU’s\n\n  * [ ![100Gb/s in my Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2157_hi_res-768x346.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/12/100gb-s-in-my-homelab-sort-of/)\n\n[Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/) | [Networking](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/networking/) | [Storage](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/storage/) | [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/)\n\n### [100Gb/s in my Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/12/100gb-s-in-my-homelab-sort-of/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) December 19, 2022November 11, 2023\n\nFor a while, I’ve been looking to update the networking at the core of my homelab.

Since starting my new role with Xtravirt my Homelab has gone through several fairly significant changes.
