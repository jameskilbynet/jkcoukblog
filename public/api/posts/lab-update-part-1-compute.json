This is known as a BigTwin configuration in SuperMicro parlance. This is something I was very familiar with as most of the Nutanix nodes that we deployed at Zen were of this design.\n\nEach node has 2x Intel Xeon CPU E5-2670 @ 2.60GHz 3 Nodes have 192GB of RAM and 1 has 128GB giving a combined 64c/128t and 704GB of RAM. Quite an amount to be squeezed into 2U.\n\nThis is a huge uplift in compute resources so is more than welcome. I also decided to put what I could in a proper rack and purchased a Startech 25U rack to mount it.\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_4536-scaled-1-768x1024.jpg) One of the Compute nodes was removed from the server\n\nThe plan is also to make a serious network investment (to move me away from 1Gb) but I haven’t completely decided what that will look like. This will likely be the final investment for a while.\n\nWith the additional Supermicro compute available I have made the Z840 a sort of standalone node. I will keep it around as it’s the only thing capable of running my Nvidia K2. \n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![New Nodes](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_6629-768x149.jpeg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/07/new-nodes/)\n\n[Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/) | [Nutanix](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/nutanix/) | [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/)\n\n### [New Nodes](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/07/new-nodes/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) July 2, 2024January 18, 2026\n\nI recently decided to update some of my homelab hosts and I managed to do this at very little cost by offloading 2 of my Supermicro e200’s to fellow vExpert Paul.
