This is known as a BigTwin configuration in SuperMicro parlance. This is something I was very familiar with as most of the Nutanix nodes that we deployed at Zen were of this design.\n\nEach node has 2x Intel Xeon CPU E5-2670 @ 2.60GHz 3 Nodes have 192GB of RAM and 1 has 128GB giving a combined 64c/128t and 704GB of RAM. Quite an amount to be squeezed into 2U.\n\nThis is a huge uplift in compute resources so is more than welcome. I also decided to put what I could in a proper rack and purchased a Startech 25U rack to mount it.\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_4536-scaled-1-768x1024.jpg) One of the Compute nodes was removed from the server\n\nThe plan is also to make a serious network investment (to move me away from 1Gb) but I haven’t completely decided what that will look like. This will likely be the final investment for a while.\n\nWith the additional Supermicro compute available I have made the Z840 a sort of standalone node. I will keep it around as it’s the only thing capable of running my Nvidia K2. \n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Managing my Homelab with SemaphoreUI](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/09/managing-my-homelab-with-semaphoreui/)\n  * [Warp &#8211; The intelligent terminal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/04/warp-the-intelligent-terminal/)\n  * [Self Hosting AI Stack using vSphere, Docker and NVIDIA GPU](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/10/self-hosting-ai-stack-using-vsphere-docker-and-nvidia-gpu/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![VMware Certified Master Specialist HCI 2020](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vmware_SP_HCI20.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2020/09/vmware-certified-master-specialist-hci-2020/)\n\n[Personal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/personal/) | [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/)\n\n### [VMware Certified Master Specialist HCI 2020](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2020/09/vmware-certified-master-specialist-hci-2020/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) September 13, 2020November 11, 2023\n\nI recently sat (and passed the VMware HCI Master Specialist exam (5V0-21.20).
