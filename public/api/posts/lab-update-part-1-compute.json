This is known as a BigTwin configuration in SuperMicro parlance. This is something I was very familiar with as most of the Nutanix nodes that we deployed at Zen were of this design.\n\nEach node has 2x Intel Xeon CPU E5-2670 @ 2.60GHz 3 Nodes have 192GB of RAM and 1 has 128GB giving a combined 64c/128t and 704GB of RAM. Quite an amount to be squeezed into 2U.\n\nThis is a huge uplift in compute resources so is more than welcome. I also decided to put what I could in a proper rack and purchased a Startech 25U rack to mount it.\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_4536-scaled-1-768x1024.jpg) One of the Compute nodes was removed from the server\n\nThe plan is also to make a serious network investment (to move me away from 1Gb) but I haven’t completely decided what that will look like. This will likely be the final investment for a while.\n\nWith the additional Supermicro compute available I have made the Z840 a sort of standalone node. I will keep it around as it’s the only thing capable of running my Nvidia K2. \n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Managing my Homelab with SemaphoreUI](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/09/managing-my-homelab-with-semaphoreui/)\n  * [Warp &#8211; The intelligent terminal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/04/warp-the-intelligent-terminal/)\n  * [Self Hosting AI Stack using vSphere, Docker and NVIDIA GPU](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/10/self-hosting-ai-stack-using-vsphere-docker-and-nvidia-gpu/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![MultiHost Holodeck VCF](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Holodeck-Overview.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/01/multihost-holodeck-vcf/)\n\n[VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/) | [VCF](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/vcf/)\n\n### [MultiHost Holodeck VCF](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/01/multihost-holodeck-vcf/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) January 17, 2024January 18, 2026\n\nHow to Deploy VMware Holodeck on multiple hosts\n\n  * [ ![VMware Certified Master Specialist HCI 2020](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vmware_SP_HCI20.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2020/09/vmware-certified-master-specialist-hci-2020/)\n\n[Personal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/personal/) | [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/)\n\n### [VMware Certified Master Specialist HCI 2020](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2020/09/vmware-certified-master-specialist-hci-2020/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) September 13, 2020November 11, 2023\n\nI recently sat (and passed the VMware HCI Master Specialist exam (5V0-21.20). I won’t go into any details of the contents but I will comment that I felt the questions were fair and that there wasn’t anything in it to trip you up. The required knowledge was certainly wider than the vSAN specialist exam.

But technically it’s possible if I dropped all drive redundancy… I recently saw an advert for a server that was just too good to be true.

This is all due to the pending acquisition by Broadcom. There are a lot of unknowns for the staff and customers about what the company will look like in the future.
