I am a huge fan of some of the tools and technology they have built. It’s not perfect and it is often not well understood by people lifting and shifting existing infrastructure into “the cloud”\n\nMy view is firmly if this is what you have done, then you have done it wrong and missed the point….\n\nBut if you do want to kick the tyres and see what it’s all about go and set up an [account and play ](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?nc2=h_ct&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start)\n\n#### Ensure you implement these three recommendations\n\n  * Root Account Security – Ensure you have a strong password on this account then stop using it. Use IAM to set up another account and then use that.\n  * Enable Two Factor Authentication – This is a must, Sadly AWS don’t appear to support my preferred 2FA device. [Yubikey](https://www.yubico.com/) so I’m using the Google authenticator\n  * Enable [Billing Alerts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/monitor_estimated_charges_with_cloudwatch.html#turning_on_billing_metrics) Create an alert so that if your bill is over X you will get a notification. It’s very easy to leave an Instance or several running somewhere. No one wants billshock.\n\nUpdate: AWS now does support Yubikey. Wahoo.\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Monitoring VMC &#8211; Part 1](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2019/12/monitoring-vmc-part-1/)\n  * [AWS Solution Architect &#8211; Associate](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2019/12/aws-solution-architect-associate/)\n  * [AWS Status Page &#8211; Monitoring Included](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2018/05/aws-status-page-monitoring-included/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/) | [AWS](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/aws/) | [Veeam](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/veeam/)\n\n### [Monitoring VMC – Part 1](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2019/12/monitoring-vmc-part-1/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) December 17, 2019October 1, 2025\n\nAs previously mentioned I have been working a lot with VMware Cloud on AWS and one of the questions that often crops up is around an approach to monitoring. This is an interesting topic as VMC is technically “as a service” therefore the monitoring approach is a bit different.

How you handle that can be a big differentiator. With VMware Cloud on AWS, the hosts are monitored 24×7 by VMware/AWS Support all as part of the service. If you pay for X number of hosts you should have X.
