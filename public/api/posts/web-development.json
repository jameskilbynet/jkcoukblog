I have now moved this site permanently over to them. This is partly related to some issues I have been having with internet access at home. Prior to this, the site ran from within my lab.\n\nThis means the site is now super fast (hopefully :p). It was cached by Cloudflare previously and now it’s served entirely from within their network.\n\n![Web performance report](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2021-12-19-at-19.30.43-2048x751-1-1024x376.png)The speed report looks good\n\nTo enable this workflow I have retained a WordPress instance running within a docker instance on my Synology. I have also set up Cloudflare teams to access this.\n\nThis allows me to have the convenience of utilising WordPress as a CMS without having to worry about the security aspect as all public content is static. It also means that I don’t care about the uptime of the particular instance.\n\nWhen I have finished writing the post I use the Simply Static Plugin to Generate the required static files. I then copy these to my wrangler site location on my laptop and ask Wrangler to publish them.\n    \n    \n    wrangler publish --env production\n\n📋 Copy\n\nI wrote a post on the initial setup of Cloudflare Workers heck it out if you are interested in more of how this works.\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Web Development Improvements](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/01/web-development-improvements/)\n  * [How I Migrated from Pocket to Hoarder with AI Integration](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/01/how-i-migrated-from-pocket-to-hoarder-and-introduced-some-ai-along-the-way/)\n  * [Analytics in a privacy focused world](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/11/analytics-in-a-privacy-focused-world/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![How I upgraded my blog as a  Static Website with GitHub Actions and Cloudflare](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Github-Actions.webp) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/10/how-i-deploy-my-blog-as-a-static-website-with-github-actions-and-cloudflare/)\n\n[Cloudflare](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/cloudflare/) | [Devops](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/devops/) | [Github](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/github/) | [Wordpress](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/wordpress/)\n\n### [How I upgraded my blog as a Static Website with GitHub Actions and Cloudflare](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/10/how-i-deploy-my-blog-as-a-static-website-with-github-actions-and-cloudflare/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) October 6, 2025January 17, 2026\n\nI wanted to automate the publishing of my blog from the authoring side to the public side. These are some of the improvements I made. What I started with My previous setup, involved a locally hosted WordPress instance. This runs in my homelab in an Ubuntu VM.

A lot of these are in “the backend” These help improve the performance, Privacy, SEO, and I have also added some security best practices. Most of these changes were done more as an exercise than due to a specific requirement.
