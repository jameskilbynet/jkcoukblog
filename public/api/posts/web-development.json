I have now moved this site permanently over to them. This is partly related to some issues I have been having with internet access at home. Prior to this, the site ran from within my lab.\n\nThis means the site is now super fast (hopefully :p). It was cached by Cloudflare previously and now it’s served entirely from within their network.\n\n![Web performance report](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2021-12-19-at-19.30.43-2048x751-1-1024x376.png)The speed report looks good\n\nTo enable this workflow I have retained a WordPress instance running within a docker instance on my Synology. I have also set up Cloudflare teams to access this.\n\nThis allows me to have the convenience of utilising WordPress as a CMS without having to worry about the security aspect as all public content is static. It also means that I don’t care about the uptime of the particular instance.\n\nWhen I have finished writing the post I use the Simply Static Plugin to Generate the required static files. I then copy these to my wrangler site location on my laptop and ask Wrangler to publish them.\n    \n    \n    wrangler publish --env production\n\n📋 Copy\n\nI wrote a post on the initial setup of Cloudflare Workers heck it out if you are interested in more of how this works.\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Web Development Improvements](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/01/web-development-improvements/)\n  * [How I Migrated from Pocket to Hoarder with AI Integration](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/01/how-i-migrated-from-pocket-to-hoarder-and-introduced-some-ai-along-the-way/)\n  * [Analytics in a privacy focused world](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/11/analytics-in-a-privacy-focused-world/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![AWS Status Page – Monitoring Included](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/AmazonWebservices_Logo.svg_-768x307.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2018/05/aws-status-page-monitoring-included/)\n\n[AWS](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/aws/) | [Hosting](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/hosting/)\n\n### [AWS Status Page – Monitoring Included](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2018/05/aws-status-page-monitoring-included/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) May 15, 2018October 1, 2025\n\nAWS Status Page – Enhancements The tool I deployed lambstatus supports pulling metrics from AWS Cloudwatch and displaying them.
