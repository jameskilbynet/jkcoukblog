But until now I had never played with it. That was until I saw the below tweet by the legend that is [William Lam](https://williamlam.com/)\n\n> 🤩 THIS IS AWESOME 🤩  \n>   \n> For those who ❤️ Automation, check out @tenthirtyam amazing repo w/working examples to build Photon OS 3/4, Ubuntu 18.04/20.04, RHEL 7/8, CentOS 7/8 & Windows Server 2016/2019 VM images using Packer & pushing to Cont Lib! Well done <https://t.co/o7FQXtrpRn>\n> \n> — William Lam (@lamw) [November 30, 2020](https://twitter.com/lamw/status/1333546472155987969?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nThat was the kicker I needed to go and have a look at getting it set up and running. As I run a Mac as my main machine it was easy to get deployed following the instructions using [brew](https://brew.sh) and the GitHub Repo that William had pointed to.\n\nHowever, once I had added my vSphere credentials I was having a few issues. On execution, I was getting the error message “default datacenter resolves to multiple instances” I did a bit of digging and discovered that the code didn’t specify a VMware datacenter and in my lab environment, I have 2 physical sites with a VMware datacenter in each, therefore, I needed to specify which one. Once this was fixed I started rolling out some Linux templates and it worked flawlessly until I got to the photon 4 server. I again spotted a typo and a syntax error on a command being passed into the photon VM. I corrected this and decided that actually, I should work out how to get this fixed upstream to help the wider community.\n\nOnce this was working it was onto the Windows templates. Once all the relevant ISO’s and configs were in place I was able to fully deploy 4 Windows servers that were patched and added to my content library in about 40mins. So whenever I go to deploy an Image it is always up to date…\n\nThanks to [Ryan](https://github.com/tenthirtyam) for an Incredible piece of work\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![Runecast Remediation Script’s](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Runecast-Solutions-Ltd.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/05/runecast-remediation-scripts/)\n\n[Runecast](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/runecast/) | [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/)\n\n### [Runecast Remediation Script’s](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/05/runecast-remediation-scripts/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) May 16, 2023November 17, 2023\n\nI am a huge fan of the Runecast product and luckily as a vExpert they give out NFR licences for my lab.
