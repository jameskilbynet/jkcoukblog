As part of the testing of this he kindly gave me a login to his WordPress instance. He has been a pretty prolific blogger over the years pumping out an amazing amount of really good content. It also highlighted to me that I didn’t know if anyone was reading my blog as i removed Google Analytics years ago over privacy concerns. I had seen from Myles’s [blog](http://blah.cloud) that he had done something similar as part of his blog revamp. Myles was using [Plausible](https://plausible.io/open-source-website-analytics) and seeing as they had a self hosted version of this I decided to give it a whirl.\n\n## Install \n\nLuckily for me Truecharts has a prebuilt plausible container so i fired that up and set an ingress entry of plausible.jameskilby.cloud on the container so that it uses my Traefik instance as an entry into my Truenas K3s environment. In my WordPress origin site I added the Plausible plugin and defined the endpoint. The last step was to expose the container to the outside world. To do this I created a public DNS record in Cloudflare and pointed this at an existing Cloudflare tunnel terminating in my Truenas K3s setup. \n\nThe entire process took approx 30 mins to setup and Im really pleased with the results. \n\n![Plausible results](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-10-at-16.42.39-1024x527.png)\n\nPlausible real time stats\n\nUpdate:\n\nI am now happy with this and have decided to make my stats public to show exactly what information I can and can’t see. This can be seen [here](https://plausible.jameskilby.cloud/jameskilby.co.uk/)\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Web Development Improvements](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/01/web-development-improvements/)\n  * [How I Migrated from Pocket to Hoarder with AI Integration](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/01/how-i-migrated-from-pocket-to-hoarder-and-introduced-some-ai-along-the-way/)\n  * [WordPress Hosting with Cloudflare Pages](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/05/how-to-take-a-wordpress-site-and-publish-it-as-a-static-site-on-cloudflare-pages/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![Advanced Deploy VMware vSphere 7.x 3V0-22.21N](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/11/advanced-deploy-vmware-vsphere-7-x-3v0-22-21n/)\n\n[VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/) | [Personal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/personal/) | [vSphere](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vsphere/)\n\n### [Advanced Deploy VMware vSphere 7.x 3V0-22.21N](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/11/advanced-deploy-vmware-vsphere-7-x-3v0-22-21n/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) November 10, 2023November 17, 2023\n\nYesterday I sat and passed the above exam.
