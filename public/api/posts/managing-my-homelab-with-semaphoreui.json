I chose to use a Docker container on one of my existing hosts.\n  * Git Repo. I am using GitHub. My code is all stored in a public repo [here](https://github.com/jameskilbynet/iac/) so others can follow along.\n  * SSH Keys/Authentication into the server to be provisioned.\n\n## Docker Configuration \n\nThis is the config that I am using (with some environment variables obscured). If you want to build your own docker run or compose file they have built a [website](https://semaphoreui.com/install/docker/2_15/) that helps you build your docker configuration. I love this. That is what I used to build the below config. \n    \n    \n    services:\n        semaphore:\n            image: semaphoreui/semaphore:v2.15.12-powershell7.5.0\n            labels:\n              - \"com.example.description=semaphore\"\n              - \"traefik.enable=true\"\n              - \"traefik.http.routers.semaphore.rule=Host(`semaphore.jameskilby.cloud`)\"\n              - \"traefik.http.routers.semaphore.entrypoints=https\"\n              - \"traefik.http.routers.semaphore.tls=true\"\n              - \"traefik.http.routers.semaphore.tls.certresolver=cloudflare\"\n              - \"traefik.http.services.semaphore.loadbalancer.server.port=3000\"\n            networks:\n              traefik:\n            environment:\n                SEMAPHORE_DB_DIALECT: bolt\n                SEMAPHORE_ADMIN: admin\n                SEMAPHORE_ADMIN_PASSWORD: XXXXXX\n                SEMAPHORE_ADMIN_NAME: James\n                SEMAPHORE_ADMIN_EMAIL: email@jameskilby.cloud\n                SEMAPHORE_RUNNER_REGISTRATION_TOKEN: \"mwsEdFU51pZDjkZsDsmws8yOvfdvdf\"\n                SEMAPHORE_EMAIL_SENDER: \"semaphore@jameskilby.cloud\"\n                SEMAPHORE_EMAIL_HOST: \"mail.jameskilby.cloud\"\n                SEMAPHORE_EMAIL_PORT: \"25\"\n                SEMAPHORE_EMAIL_SECURE: \"True\"\n            volumes:\n                - semaphore_data:/var/lib/semaphore\n                - semaphore_config:/etc/semaphore\n                - semaphore_tmp:/tmp/semaphore\n    volumes:\n        semaphore_data:\n        semaphore_config:\n        semaphore_tmp:\n    \n    networks:\n      traefik:\n        external: true\n\n📋 Copy\n\n## Playbook Walkthrough\n\nOnce Semaphore is up and running, you can start setting up your automation pipelines. I will step through an example Ansible Playbook to deploy Docker. This playbook can be found [here](https://github.com/jameskilbynet/iac/blob/b65d7f8d014cb5458c74f5188798b3129387f36e/ansible/docker/install_docker.yml). Let me walk you through the playbook, then we will demonstrate using Semaphore to execute this.\n\n### Playbook Metadata\n    \n    \n    - name: Install Docker on supported Ubuntu hosts\n      hosts: all\n      become: yes\n\n📋 Copy\n\nThis defines the hosts to run the playbook on (for now, this should just be set to all), and the become option allows it to become root if needed.\n    \n    \n    vars:\n      docker_gpg_path: /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg\n      docker_repo: \"deb [arch=amd64 signed-by={{ docker_gpg_path }}] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu {{ ansible_distribution_release }} stable\"\n\n📋 Copy\n\nThis defines the variables of where we will store the Docker GPG Key and the Docker repo\n\nWe then use Ansible to define some variables and to ensure we are getting the correct Docker release based on the Version of Ubuntu.\n\n### Define Variables\n    \n    \n    tasks:\n        - name: Ensure required system packages are present\n          apt:\n            name:\n              - apt-transport-https\n              - ca-certificates\n              - curl\n              - gnupg\n              - lsb-release\n            state: present\n            update_cache: yes\n    \n\n📋 Copy\n\nThe next block ensures that the required packages are present on the system.\n\n### Handle reboots\n    \n    \n    - name: Check if a reboot is required\n      stat:\n        path: /var/run/reboot-required\n      register: reboot_required\n    \n    - name: Reboot the machine if required\n      reboot:\n        msg: \"Reboot initiated by Ansible due to package upgrade.\"\n        pre_reboot_delay: 60\n        reboot_timeout: 600\n        post_reboot_delay: 60\n      when: reboot_required.stat.exists\n\n📋 Copy\n\n### Preps APT and stores GPG Keys\n    \n    \n    - name: Ensure /etc/apt/keyrings directory exists\n      file:\n        path: /etc/apt/keyrings\n        state: directory\n        mode: '0755'\n    - name: Download Docker GPG key in dearmored format\n      shell: |\n        curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | gpg --dearmor -o {{ docker_gpg_path }}\n      args:\n        creates: \"{{ docker_gpg_path }}\"\n    - name: Set permissions on Docker GPG key\n      file:\n        path: \"{{ docker_gpg_path }}\"\n        mode: '0644'\n    - name: Set permissions on Docker GPG key\n      file:\n        path: \"{{ docker_gpg_path }}\"\n        mode: '0644'\n    \n\n📋 Copy\n\n### Install Docker and ensure it’s running\n    \n    \n        - name: Install Docker Engine and related packages\n          apt:\n            name:\n              - docker-ce\n              - docker-ce-cli\n              - containerd.io\n              - docker-buildx-plugin\n              - docker-compose-plugin\n            state: latest\n    \n        - name: Ensure Docker service is running and enabled\n          service:\n            name: docker\n            state: started\n            enabled: true\n\n📋 Copy\n\n# Semaphore Concepts\n\nSo now that we understand the playbook, let’s go over some of the Semaphore concepts\n\n### Projects\n\nFirst we need a project. A project is used for separating out management activity. This could be as Prod/Test/Dev etc or for managing different systems or applications. To keep everything easy right now I am running everything in a single project. I will likely split this out a bit later.\n\n### Task Templates\n\nThe task templates are the actions that we want Sempahore to perform for us. In the example, I will just be using it to deploy Docker onto host’s specified in the Inventory.\n\n### Schedule\n\nA schedule is an easy way to run a specified task repeatedly. Fairly self-explanatory, I am using this to run a weekly patching schedule on most of my Ubuntu servers.\n\n### Inventory\n\nThe Inventory specifies hosts to be managed with the appropriate credentials.\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Sempahore-Inventory.png)\n\n### Variable Groups\n\nVariable Groups are used for storing additional variables for an inventory. They must be in the JSON format.\n\nI am not using these as part of my Docker example.\n\n### Key Store\n\nThe key store is for storing all credentials. This is for connecting to remote hosts to execute jobs but also for accessing code repositories. \n\n### Repositories\n\nA repository defines where the code that Semaphore executes lives. It’s possible to have multiple repo’s connected. I have a single one defined, and I am using a public repo for two reasons. Firstly, so anyone else can copy the configuration I am using. Secondly to enforce me being more secure and not putting any secrets in any of the code. Something that I sometimes do for speed with my lab.\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Semaphore-Repo-1024x80.png)\n\n## Execute\n\nNow that we have gone over the basic concepts. Let’s deploy Docker using Semaphore.\n\nFor testing, I have spun up a Vanilla Ubuntu 24.04 server to be used as the Docker server and created a new Project to ensure that we are starting from scratch.\n\n## Repositories\n\n### Connect your repository \n\nStep 1: Connect your repository\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/New-Repo-1024x350.png)\n\nAnd define the appropriate config. I am just using the Main branch and require no authentication as it’s a public GitHub repo\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Repo-Settings.png)\n\n## Update your Key Store\n\nStep 2\n\nCreate the credentials for Semiphore to authenticate against your remote server. \n\nI am using SSH keys to authenticate against the system, and the account can elevate without a password\n\n## Define your Inventory\n\nStep 3 is to define the Inventory of systems you want the task to be run against.\n\nThis requires a name and the user credentials defined in step 2.\n\nFor demo purposes, I am just using the IP address of the remote server. All of my homelab servers are connected via DNS, and I am using a simple static list. \n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ansible-Inventory.png)\n\n## Define the task you want to run\n\nGo to the “Task Templates” section, select a new template and then select Ansible Playbook\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-02-at-13.28.53.png)\n\nAdd the required variables; for this particular task, only a few are needed.\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Docker-Task-1-1024x553.png)\n\nOnce the task is created, simply press the play button to execute it.\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Task-Running.png)\n\nSemaphore will clone the GitHub repo and then start executing the tasks defined in the Ansible playbook as can be seen above. The big green success button at the top tells you that all of the tasks executed successfully. \n\nAs the playbook rolls off the screen I have a copy of it in full that can be seen below.\n    \n    \n    4:33:00 PM\n    Task 2147483445 added to queue\n    4:33:00 PM\n    Started: 2147483445\n    4:33:00 PM\n    Run TaskRunner with template: Install Docker\n    4:33:00 PM\n    Preparing: 2147483445\n    4:33:00 PM\n    Cloning Repository https://github.com/jameskilbynet/iac\n    4:33:00 PM\n    Cloning into 'repository_1_template_1'...\n    4:33:01 PM\n    Get current commit hash\n    4:33:01 PM\n    Get current commit message\n    4:33:01 PM\n    installing static inventory\n    4:33:01 PM\n    No /tmp/semaphore/project_2/repository_1_template_1/ansible/docker/collections/requirements.yml file found.

I might write some more posts on how I am using it for more complex tasks. The one thing I wish it could do natively is Packer for building templates, but just with Terraform and Ansible, it is making my life so much easier.\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![Intel Optane NVMe Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/intel_optane_ssd_900p_series_aic_-_right_angle_575px.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/04/intel-optane/)\n\n[Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/) | [Storage](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/storage/) | [vExpert](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vexpert/)\n\n### [Intel Optane NVMe Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/04/intel-optane/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) April 17, 2023October 1, 2025\n\nI have been a VMware vExpert for many years and it has brought me many many benefits over the years.
