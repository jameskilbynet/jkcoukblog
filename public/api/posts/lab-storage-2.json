At the moment it’s very much focused on the VMware stack and one of the things I needed was some more storage and especially some more storage performance. With that in mind, I purchased a new Synology DS918\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/iu-768x432-1.jpg)\n\nIt’s a very compact unit with a quad-core Intel Celeron & I have left the RAM at 4 GB for now.\n\nI have added some of the existing SSD’s that I had giving me about 3TB of usable flash. I am presenting this back to my VMware hosts using NFS 4.1. I must have missed the announcement as this is now built into the Synology GUI ( It used to be a command-line-only option) I have verified the VAAI works as expected in this configuration. At present I am using this with a single network connection however I will be testing NFS Multipathing shortly.\n\nThe performance improvement has been noticeable and I have now removed all non-Synology systems from primary storage. This has left me with the DS918+ detailed here and a DS216+ with 2TB of Raid1 WD Reds. I am using this for ISO’s and some general file storage.\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![New Nodes](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_6629-768x149.jpeg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/07/new-nodes/)\n\n[Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/) | [Nutanix](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/nutanix/) | [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/)\n\n### [New Nodes](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/07/new-nodes/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) July 2, 2024January 18, 2026\n\nI recently decided to update some of my homelab hosts and I managed to do this at very little cost by offloading 2 of my Supermicro e200’s to fellow vExpert Paul.
