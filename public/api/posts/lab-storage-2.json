At the moment it’s very much focused on the VMware stack and one of the things I needed was some more storage and especially some more storage performance. With that in mind, I purchased a new Synology DS918\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/iu-768x432-1.jpg)\n\nIt’s a very compact unit with a quad-core Intel Celeron & I have left the RAM at 4 GB for now.\n\nI have added some of the existing SSD’s that I had giving me about 3TB of usable flash. I am presenting this back to my VMware hosts using NFS 4.1. I must have missed the announcement as this is now built into the Synology GUI ( It used to be a command-line-only option) I have verified the VAAI works as expected in this configuration. At present I am using this with a single network connection however I will be testing NFS Multipathing shortly.\n\nThe performance improvement has been noticeable and I have now removed all non-Synology systems from primary storage. This has left me with the DS918+ detailed here and a DS216+ with 2TB of Raid1 WD Reds. I am using this for ISO’s and some general file storage.\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![Runecast Remediation Script’s](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Runecast-Solutions-Ltd.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/05/runecast-remediation-scripts/)\n\n[Runecast](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/runecast/) | [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/)\n\n### [Runecast Remediation Script’s](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/05/runecast-remediation-scripts/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) May 16, 2023November 17, 2023\n\nI am a huge fan of the Runecast product and luckily as a vExpert they give out NFR licences for my lab.
