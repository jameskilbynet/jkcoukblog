I don’t think it’s an understatement to say I probably wouldn’t have my current role within VMware without it. One of the best benefits has been access to a huge amount of licences for VMware software to use in my lab. Some third parties have also recognised the award and given licences for their software. Two that I have probably made the most use of is [Runecast](https://www.runecast.com) and [Devolutions](https://devolutions.net) Remote Desktop Manager. \n\nHowever recently a few bits of hardware have become available and one piece in particular peeked my interest in particular some Optane drives thanks to the very generous folks at Intel.\n\nI was lucky enough to get some together with [Gareth Edwards](http://www.virtualisedfruit.co.uk) we decided to put something together to show how good the Optane drives are and have a friendly bit of competition. \n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_2109-1024x683.jpeg)\n\nGareth is going to keep most of the drives to start with doing some vSAN testing and I have added two to my TrueNas Server. This has both iSCSI and NFS connections back to my ESXi hosts.\n\nTo be honest it would be tricky to get more than that in my storage box (in the PCI format)\n\nWe’re planning on doing some back to back test to showcase the performance difference. I am going to do this by benchmarking from VMware the following drive pairs running in my Truenas “SAN”\n\nI will also configure the Optane’s as “SLOG” attached to my main SSD storage pool. See my [TrueNAS ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/05/homelab-storage-refresh-part-1/)post for more details of the setup\n\nDrive| Model | Size| Manufacturers Read IOPS| Manufacturer Write IOPS| Max Read Sequential MB/s| Max Write Sequential MB/s  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nConsumer SSD | Samsung EVO 860 2TB | 2TB | 97,000 | 88,000 | 550 | 520  \nEnterprise SSD | Samsung PM863 | 960GB | 99,000 | 18,000 | 520 | 475  \nIntel Optane | SSD DC P4800X | 750GB | 550,000 | 550,000 | 2500 | 2200  \n  \n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![MultiHost Holodeck VCF](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Holodeck-Overview.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/01/multihost-holodeck-vcf/)\n\n[VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/) | [VCF](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/vcf/)\n\n### [MultiHost Holodeck VCF](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/01/multihost-holodeck-vcf/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) January 17, 2024December 27, 2025\n\nHow to Deploy VMware Holodeck on multiple hosts\n\n  * [ ![How to Fix Portainer Agent not Starting On Synology DSM](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Docker-Symbol-1-2199360526-768x528.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/03/portainer-agent-on-synology-dsm/)\n\n[Docker](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/docker/) | [Portainer](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/portainer/) | [Synology](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/synology/)\n\n### [How to Fix Portainer Agent not Starting On Synology DSM](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/03/portainer-agent-on-synology-dsm/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) March 11, 2025December 27, 2025\n\nHow to fix Portainer Agent no starting on Synology\n\n  * [ ![How to Run ZFS on VMware vSphere: Setup Guide and Best Practices](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ZFS.jpg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/12/zfs-on-vmware/)\n\n[TrueNAS Scale](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/truenas-scale/) | [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/) | [vSAN](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/vsan-vmware/) | [vSphere](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vsphere/)\n\n### [How to Run ZFS on VMware vSphere: Setup Guide and Best Practices](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/12/zfs-on-vmware/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) December 18, 2024December 27, 2025\n\nTable of Contents Copy-on-Write Disk IDs Trim I have run a number of systems using ZFS since the earliest days of my homelab using Nexenta, all the way back in 2010.
