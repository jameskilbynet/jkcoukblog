I don’t think it’s an understatement to say I probably wouldn’t have my current role within VMware without it. One of the best benefits has been access to a huge amount of licences for VMware software to use in my lab. Some third parties have also recognised the award and given licences for their software. Two that I have probably made the most use of is [Runecast](https://www.runecast.com) and [Devolutions](https://devolutions.net) Remote Desktop Manager. \n\nHowever recently a few bits of hardware have become available and one piece in particular peeked my interest in particular some Optane drives thanks to the very generous folks at Intel.\n\nI was lucky enough to get some together with [Gareth Edwards](http://www.virtualisedfruit.co.uk) we decided to put something together to show how good the Optane drives are and have a friendly bit of competition. \n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_2109-1024x683.jpeg)\n\nGareth is going to keep most of the drives to start with doing some vSAN testing and I have added two to my TrueNas Server. This has both iSCSI and NFS connections back to my ESXi hosts.\n\nTo be honest it would be tricky to get more than that in my storage box (in the PCI format)\n\nWe’re planning on doing some back to back test to showcase the performance difference. I am going to do this by benchmarking from VMware the following drive pairs running in my Truenas “SAN”\n\nI will also configure the Optane’s as “SLOG” attached to my main SSD storage pool. See my [TrueNAS ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/05/homelab-storage-refresh-part-1/)post for more details of the setup\n\nDrive| Model | Size| Manufacturers Read IOPS| Manufacturer Write IOPS| Max Read Sequential MB/s| Max Write Sequential MB/s  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nConsumer SSD | Samsung EVO 860 2TB | 2TB | 97,000 | 88,000 | 550 | 520  \nEnterprise SSD | Samsung PM863 | 960GB | 99,000 | 18,000 | 520 | 475  \nIntel Optane | SSD DC P4800X | 750GB | 550,000 | 550,000 | 2500 | 2200  \n  \n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Managing my Homelab with SemaphoreUI](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/09/managing-my-homelab-with-semaphoreui/)\n  * [Warp &#8211; The intelligent terminal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/04/warp-the-intelligent-terminal/)\n  * [Self Hosting AI Stack using vSphere, Docker and NVIDIA GPU](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/10/self-hosting-ai-stack-using-vsphere-docker-and-nvidia-gpu/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![Wa](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/210902461-012e7273-413a-4ec7-be44-e854347f5a21-768x180.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/04/warp-the-intelligent-terminal/)\n\n[Artificial Intelligence](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/artificial-intelligence/) | [Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/)\n\n### [Warp – The intelligent terminal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/04/warp-the-intelligent-terminal/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) April 11, 2025October 3, 2025\n\nHow Warp is helping me run my homelab. \n\n  * [ ![How to Fix Portainer Agent not Starting On Synology DSM](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Docker-Symbol-1-2199360526-768x528.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/03/portainer-agent-on-synology-dsm/)\n\n[Docker](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/docker/) | [Portainer](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/portainer/) | [Synology](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/synology/)\n\n### [How to Fix Portainer Agent not Starting On Synology DSM](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/03/portainer-agent-on-synology-dsm/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) March 11, 2025December 27, 2025\n\nHow to fix Portainer Agent no starting on Synology\n\n  * [ ![Can you really squeeze 96TB in 1U ?](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/QuantaGrid-SD1Q-1ULH-Front-Three-Quarter.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/09/can-you-really-squeeze-96tb-in-1u/)\n\n[Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/) | [Storage](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/storage/) | [TrueNAS Scale](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/truenas-scale/)\n\n### [Can you really squeeze 96TB in 1U ?](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/09/can-you-really-squeeze-96tb-in-1u/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) September 12, 2024January 28, 2026\n\nYes, that’s a clickbait title. But technically it’s possible if I dropped all drive redundancy… I recently saw an advert for a server that was just too good to be true. It promised to bring a huge amount of storage and future options in a quite hard-to-believe 1U. The price it was on offer for…\n\n  * [ ![Lab Update – Part 2 Storage Truenas Scale](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/maxresdefault-768x432.jpeg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/01/lab-update-part-2-storage/)\n\n[Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/) | [Storage](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/storage/)\n\n### [Lab Update – Part 2 Storage Truenas Scale](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/01/lab-update-part-2-storage/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) January 11, 2022December 11, 2023\n\nThe HP Z840 has changed its role to a permanent storage box running Truenas Scale.

So with the release of vSphere 8 I was obviously going to upgrade however a few personal things blocked me from doing it until now. The vCenter upgrade was smooth however knowing that some of the hardware I am running…\n\n  * [Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/) | [Veeam](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/veeam/) | [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/)\n\n### [Lab Update – Desired Workloads](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/01/lab-update-part-5-desired-workloads/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) January 6, 2022November 11, 2023\n\nMy lab is always undergoing change.
