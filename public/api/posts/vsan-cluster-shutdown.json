I have a GPU/Management cluster that is usually running 24×7. I also have a 3x Node vSAN cluster that I use when I need more resources (or specifically if I need vSAN to test with)\n\nThis allows me to \n\nSee the overview below\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/vSphere-Overview-1024x530.png)\n\nTo shut down a vSAN cluster, there is a nice workflow built into vCentre that will orchestrate all the required actions for you\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/vSAN-Services-Menu-1024x564.png)\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Shutdown-Precheck.png)\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Confirmation.png)\n\nAnd there you have it…\n\nTo restart the cluster, ensure all the hosts are booted. Leave them in maintenance mode and then select “Restart vSAN Services” The workflow will enable them to bring them back into operation. \n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Restart-vSAN.png)Restart vSAN Services\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Using Content Libraries in VMC to deploy software faster](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/01/using-content-libraries-in-vmc-to-deploy-software-faster/)\n  * [Automating the deployment of my Homelab AI Infrastructure](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/01/automating-the-deployment-of-my-ai-homelab-and-other-improvements/)\n  * [An in-depth look at VMware Cloud on AWS hosts](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/08/vmc-host-deepdive/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![Holodeck CPU Fixes](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/40oOd8IipPvtrPJs-1198788743-768x737.jpg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/01/holodeck-cpu-fixes/)\n\n[VCF](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/vcf/) | [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/)\n\n### [Holodeck CPU Fixes](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/01/holodeck-cpu-fixes/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) January 18, 2024July 10, 2024\n\nHow to deploy Holodeck with Legacy CPU’s\n\n  * [ ![VMware – Going out with a Bang!](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/rnli-logo-768x384.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/10/going-out-with-a-bang/)\n\n[VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/) | [Personal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/personal/)\n\n### [VMware – Going out with a Bang!](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/10/going-out-with-a-bang/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) October 7, 2023November 17, 2023\n\nThere is a lot of uncertainty with VMware at the moment.
