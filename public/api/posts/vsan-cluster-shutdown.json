I have a GPU/Management cluster that is usually running 24×7. I also have a 3x Node vSAN cluster that I use when I need more resources (or specifically if I need vSAN to test with)\n\nThis allows me to \n\nSee the overview below\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/vSphere-Overview-1024x530.png)\n\nTo shut down a vSAN cluste,r there is a nice workflow built into vCentre that will orchestrate all the required actions for you\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/vSAN-Services-Menu-1024x564.png)\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Shutdown-Precheck.png)\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Confirmation.png)\n\nAnd there you have it…\n\nTo restart the cluster, ensure all the hosts are booted. Leave them in maintenance mode and then select “Restart vSAN Services” The workflow will enable them to bring them back into operation. \n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Restart-vSAN.png)Restart vSAN Services\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Using Content Libraries in VMC to deploy software faster](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/01/using-content-libraries-in-vmc-to-deploy-software-faster/)\n  * [An in-depth look at VMware Cloud on AWS hosts](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/08/vmc-host-deepdive/)\n  * [VMC Quick Sizing Guide](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/05/vmc-quick-sizing-guide/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/) | [Veeam](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/veeam/) | [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/)\n\n### [Lab Update – Desired Workloads](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/01/lab-update-part-5-desired-workloads/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) January 6, 2022November 11, 2023\n\nMy lab is always undergoing change.
