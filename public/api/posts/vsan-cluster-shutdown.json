I have a GPU/Management cluster that is usually running 24×7. I also have a 3x Node vSAN cluster that I use when I need more resources (or specifically if I need vSAN to test with)\n\nThis allows me to \n\nSee the overview below\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/vSphere-Overview-1024x530.png)\n\nTo shut down a vSAN cluste,r there is a nice workflow built into vCentre that will orchestrate all the required actions for you\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/vSAN-Services-Menu-1024x564.png)\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Shutdown-Precheck.png)\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Confirmation.png)\n\nAnd there you have it…\n\nTo restart the cluster, ensure all the hosts are booted. Leave them in maintenance mode and then select “Restart vSAN Services” The workflow will enable them to bring them back into operation. \n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Restart-vSAN.png)Restart vSAN Services\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Using Content Libraries in VMC to deploy software faster](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/01/using-content-libraries-in-vmc-to-deploy-software-faster/)\n  * [An in-depth look at VMware Cloud on AWS hosts](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/08/vmc-host-deepdive/)\n  * [VMC Quick Sizing Guide](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/05/vmc-quick-sizing-guide/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/01/lab-update-part-1-compute/)\n\n[Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/) | [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/)\n\n### [Lab Update – Compute](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/01/lab-update-part-1-compute/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) January 6, 2022July 10, 2024\n\nQuite a few changes have happened in the lab recently. so I decided to do a multipart blog on the changes. The refresh was triggered by the purchase of a SuperMicro Server (2027TR-H71FRF) chassis with 4x X9DRT Nodes / Blades. This is known as a BigTwin configuration in SuperMicro parlance.

Partially as I want to try new things or new ways of doing things. Sometimes because I break things (not always by accident) sometimes it’s a great way to learn….

So with the release of vSphere 8 I was obviously going to upgrade however a few personal things blocked me from doing it until now. The vCenter upgrade was smooth however knowing that some of the hardware I am running…\n\n  * [ ![Time in a VMC Environment](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Picture-1-e1768509620339-768x193.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/12/time-in-a-vmc-environment/)\n\n[VMware Cloud on AWS](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/vmware-cloud-on-aws/)\n\n### [Time in a VMC Environment](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/12/time-in-a-vmc-environment/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) December 8, 2025January 17, 2026\n\nOne of the nice things about the VMC Service is that you dont have to worry about a number of the traditional infrastructure services that you typically obsess over when your running your own infrastructure. One of those is Time…. A key requirement for any enterprise platform.
