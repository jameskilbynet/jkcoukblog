I have a GPU/Management cluster that is usually running 24×7. I also have a 3x Node vSAN cluster that I use when I need more resources (or specifically if I need vSAN to test with)\n\nThis allows me to \n\nSee the overview below\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/vSphere-Overview-1024x530.png)\n\nTo shut down a vSAN cluste,r there is a nice workflow built into vCentre that will orchestrate all the required actions for you\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/vSAN-Services-Menu-1024x564.png)\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Shutdown-Precheck.png)\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Confirmation.png)\n\nAnd there you have it…\n\nTo restart the cluster, ensure all the hosts are booted. Leave them in maintenance mode and then select “Restart vSAN Services” The workflow will enable them to bring them back into operation. \n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Restart-vSAN.png)Restart vSAN Services\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Using Content Libraries in VMC to deploy software faster](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/01/using-content-libraries-in-vmc-to-deploy-software-faster/)\n  * [An in-depth look at VMware Cloud on AWS hosts](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/08/vmc-host-deepdive/)\n  * [VMC Quick Sizing Guide](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/05/vmc-quick-sizing-guide/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![An in-depth look at VMware Cloud on AWS hosts](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Picture-1-e1768509620339-768x193.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/08/vmc-host-deepdive/)\n\n[VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/) | [VMware Cloud on AWS](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/vmware-cloud-on-aws/)\n\n### [An in-depth look at VMware Cloud on AWS hosts](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/08/vmc-host-deepdive/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) August 14, 2025January 18, 2026\n\nThis is single page intended to collate every single feature of the current VMware Cloud on AWS hosts for easy comparison.

This is based on the i3en.metal AWS instance. The specifications are certainly impressive packing in 96 logical cores, 768GiB RAM, and approximately 45.84 TiB of NVMe raw storage capacity per host.
