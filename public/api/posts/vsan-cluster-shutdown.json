I have a GPU/Management cluster that is usually running 24×7. I also have a 3x Node vSAN cluster that I use when I need more resources (or specifically if I need vSAN to test with)\n\nThis allows me to \n\nSee the overview below\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/vSphere-Overview-1024x530.png)\n\nTo shut down a vSAN cluster, there is a nice workflow built into vCentre that will orchestrate all the required actions for you\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/vSAN-Services-Menu-1024x564.png)\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Shutdown-Precheck.png)\n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Confirmation.png)\n\nAnd there you have it…\n\nTo restart the cluster, ensure all the hosts are booted. Leave them in maintenance mode and then select “Restart vSAN Services” The workflow will enable them to bring them back into operation. \n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Restart-vSAN.png)Restart vSAN Services\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Automating the deployment of my Homelab AI Infrastructure](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/02/automating-the-deployment-of-my-ai-homelab-and-other-improvements/)\n  * [Using Content Libraries in VMC to deploy software faster](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2026/01/using-content-libraries-in-vmc-to-deploy-software-faster/)\n  * [An in-depth look at VMware Cloud on AWS hosts](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/08/vmc-host-deepdive/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![Forcing an Upgrade to vSphere 8](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-14-at-21.45.23.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/12/forcing-an-upgrade-to-vsphere-8/)\n\n[Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/) | [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/) | [vSphere](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vsphere/)\n\n### [Forcing an Upgrade to vSphere 8](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/12/forcing-an-upgrade-to-vsphere-8/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) December 14, 2022October 1, 2025\n\nI run a reasonably extensive homelab that is of course built around the VMware ecosystem.
