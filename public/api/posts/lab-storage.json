Although it changes frequently at present it’s as below. I will add some pics when I have tidied up the lab/cables\n\nMy primary lab storage is all contained within an HP Gen8 Microserver.\n\nCurrently Configured:\n\n1x INTEL Core i3-4130 running at 2.3Ghz\n\n16Gb of RAM\n\n4x 1Gb/s NIC\n\n2x 3TB WD Red\n\n2x Intel SSD 320 Series 80GB, 25nm MLC\n\nThis is running Xpenology.\n\nI have the 4 Nics split into two LACP bonds. One for the management traffic and one for pure NFS traffic.\n\nThe 2xWD Red’s are in an SHR configuration with the SSDs running as a SSD read-write cache\n\nThis gives me 2.6TB Useable which is plenty to lab and store photos and media and with the RW cache, the perf is pretty dam good.\n\nI also have a DS216+II Synology with 2x 2TB WD Red’s this is my tier 2 lab storage. for backups ISO’s etc\n\nI am running a few apps/containers on the Xpenology install as it has a lot more ram/processing power.\n\nAt the moment this consists of:\n\nDocker – GitLab\n\nDocker – PHPipam\n\nPlex\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Managing my Homelab with SemaphoreUI](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/09/managing-my-homelab-with-semaphoreui/)\n  * [Warp &#8211; The intelligent terminal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/04/warp-the-intelligent-terminal/)\n  * [Self Hosting AI Stack using vSphere, Docker and NVIDIA GPU](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/10/self-hosting-ai-stack-using-vsphere-docker-and-nvidia-gpu/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![Managing my Homelab with SemaphoreUI](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/semaphore-768x768.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/09/managing-my-homelab-with-semaphoreui/)\n\n[Ansible](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/ansible/) | [Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/)\n\n### [Managing my Homelab with SemaphoreUI](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/09/managing-my-homelab-with-semaphoreui/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) September 2, 2025December 18, 2025\n\nI recently stumbled across Semaphore, which is essentially a frontend for managing DevOps tooling, including Ansible, Terraform, OpenTofu, and PowerShell. It’s easy to deploy in Docker, and I am slowly moving more of my homelab management over to it.

Partially as I want to try new things or new ways of doing things. Sometimes because I break things (not always by accident) sometimes it’s a great way to learn…. I decided to list the workloads I am looking to run (some of these are already in place) Infrastucture…\n\n  * [ ![Forcing an Upgrade to vSphere 8](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-14-at-21.45.23.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/12/forcing-an-upgrade-to-vsphere-8/)\n\n[Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/) | [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/) | [vSphere](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vsphere/)\n\n### [Forcing an Upgrade to vSphere 8](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/12/forcing-an-upgrade-to-vsphere-8/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) December 14, 2022October 1, 2025\n\nI run a reasonably extensive homelab that is of course built around the VMware ecosystem. So with the release of vSphere 8 I was obviously going to upgrade however a few personal things blocked me from doing it until now. The vCenter upgrade was smooth however knowing that some of the hardware I am running…\n\n  * [ ![Lab Storage](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/81-ZoEW24UL._SL1500_-768x461.jpg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2019/02/lab-storage-2/)\n\n[Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/)\n\n### [Lab Storage](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2019/02/lab-storage-2/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) February 10, 2019July 10, 2024\n\nLab Storage Update. Since starting my new role with Xtravirt my Homelab has gone through several fairly significant changes. At the moment it’s very much focused on the VMware stack and one of the things I needed was some more storage and especially some more storage performance. With that in mind, I purchased a new Synology…\n\n  * [ ![Self Hosting AI Stack using vSphere, Docker and NVIDIA GPU](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/pexels-tara-winstead-8386440-768x512.jpg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/10/self-hosting-ai-stack-using-vsphere-docker-and-nvidia-gpu/)\n\n[Artificial Intelligence](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/artificial-intelligence/) | [Docker](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/docker/) | [Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/)\n\n### [Self Hosting AI Stack using vSphere, Docker and NVIDIA GPU](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/10/self-hosting-ai-stack-using-vsphere-docker-and-nvidia-gpu/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) October 11, 2024October 1, 2025\n\nArtificial intelligence is all the rage at the moment, It’s getting included in every product announcement from pretty much every vendor under the sun. Nvidia’s stock price has gone to the moon. So I thought I better get some knowledge and understand some of this.

I don’t think it’s an understatement to say I probably wouldn’t have my current role within VMware without it. One of the best benefits has been access to a huge amount of licences for VMware…",
