One for the management traffic and one for pure NFS traffic.\n\nThe 2xWD Red’s are in an SHR configuration with the SSDs running as a SSD read-write cache\n\nThis gives me 2.6TB Useable which is plenty to lab and store photos and media and with the RW cache, the perf is pretty dam good.\n\nI also have a DS216+II Synology with 2x 2TB WD Red’s this is my tier 2 lab storage. for backups ISO’s etc\n\nI am running a few apps/containers on the Xpenology install as it has a lot more ram/processing power.\n\nAt the moment this consists of:\n\nDocker – GitLab\n\nDocker – PHPipam\n\nPlex\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Managing my Homelab with SemaphoreUI](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/09/managing-my-homelab-with-semaphoreui/)\n  * [Warp &#8211; The intelligent terminal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/04/warp-the-intelligent-terminal/)\n  * [Self Hosting AI Stack using vSphere, Docker and NVIDIA GPU](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/10/self-hosting-ai-stack-using-vsphere-docker-and-nvidia-gpu/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![Use Portainer in a Homelab with GitHub](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/22225832.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/12/use-portainer-in-a-homelab-with-github/)\n\n[Docker](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/docker/) | [Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/) | [Hosting](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/hosting/) | [Kubernetes](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/kubernetes/)\n\n### [Use Portainer in a Homelab with GitHub](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/12/use-portainer-in-a-homelab-with-github/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) December 9, 2022October 1, 2025\n\nLate to the party or not, I have been using containers in my lab more and more and that has led me to Portainer….
