Although it changes frequently at present it’s as below. I will add some pics when I have tidied up the lab/cables\n\nMy primary lab storage is all contained within an HP Gen8 Microserver.\n\nCurrently Configured:\n\n1x INTEL Core i3-4130 running at 2.3Ghz\n\n16Gb of RAM\n\n4x 1Gb/s NIC\n\n2x 3TB WD Red\n\n2x Intel SSD 320 Series 80GB, 25nm MLC\n\nThis is running Xpenology.\n\nI have the 4 Nics split into two LACP bonds. One for the management traffic and one for pure NFS traffic.\n\nThe 2xWD Red’s are in an SHR configuration with the SSDs running as a SSD read-write cache\n\nThis gives me 2.6TB Useable which is plenty to lab and store photos and media and with the RW cache, the perf is pretty dam good.\n\nI also have a DS216+II Synology with 2x 2TB WD Red’s this is my tier 2 lab storage. for backups ISO’s etc\n\nI am running a few apps/containers on the Xpenology install as it has a lot more ram/processing power.\n\nAt the moment this consists of:\n\nDocker – GitLab\n\nDocker – PHPipam\n\nPlex\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![VMC – vSAN ESA](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/OrigionalPoweredByvSAN-550x324-1.jpg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/11/vsan-esa-and-the-improvements-it-brings-to-vmc/)\n\n[VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/) | [VMware Cloud on AWS](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/vmware-cloud-on-aws/) | [vSAN](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/vsan-vmware/)\n\n### [VMC – vSAN ESA](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/11/vsan-esa-and-the-improvements-it-brings-to-vmc/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) November 17, 2023July 10, 2024\n\nAn Overview of vSAN ESA in VMC \n\n  * [ ![Can you really squeeze 96TB in 1U ?](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/QuantaGrid-SD1Q-1ULH-Front-Three-Quarter.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/09/can-you-really-squeeze-96tb-in-1u/)\n\n[Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/) | [Storage](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/storage/) | [TrueNAS Scale](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/truenas-scale/)\n\n### [Can you really squeeze 96TB in 1U ?](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/09/can-you-really-squeeze-96tb-in-1u/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) September 12, 2024January 28, 2026\n\nYes, that’s a clickbait title. But technically it’s possible if I dropped all drive redundancy… I recently saw an advert for a server that was just too good to be true. It promised to bring a huge amount of storage and future options in a quite hard-to-believe 1U.
