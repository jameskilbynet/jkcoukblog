Although it changes frequently at present it’s as below. I will add some pics when I have tidied up the lab/cables\n\nMy primary lab storage is all contained within an HP Gen8 Microserver.\n\nCurrently Configured:\n\n1x INTEL Core i3-4130 running at 2.3Ghz\n\n16Gb of RAM\n\n4x 1Gb/s NIC\n\n2x 3TB WD Red\n\n2x Intel SSD 320 Series 80GB, 25nm MLC\n\nThis is running Xpenology.\n\nI have the 4 Nics split into two LACP bonds. One for the management traffic and one for pure NFS traffic.\n\nThe 2xWD Red’s are in an SHR configuration with the SSDs running as a SSD read-write cache\n\nThis gives me 2.6TB Useable which is plenty to lab and store photos and media and with the RW cache, the perf is pretty dam good.\n\nI also have a DS216+II Synology with 2x 2TB WD Red’s this is my tier 2 lab storage. for backups ISO’s etc\n\nI am running a few apps/containers on the Xpenology install as it has a lot more ram/processing power.\n\nAt the moment this consists of:\n\nDocker – GitLab\n\nDocker – PHPipam\n\nPlex\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![Holodeck CPU Fixes](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/40oOd8IipPvtrPJs-1198788743-768x737.jpg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/01/holodeck-cpu-fixes/)\n\n[VCF](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/vcf/) | [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/)\n\n### [Holodeck CPU Fixes](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/01/holodeck-cpu-fixes/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) January 18, 2024July 10, 2024\n\nHow to deploy Holodeck with Legacy CPU’s\n\n  * [ ![Configure DHCP Option 43 for UniFi devices to enable remote adoption across subnets](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ubiquiti_Networks-Logo.wine_-768x512.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/06/unifi-dhcp-option-43/)\n\n[Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/) | [Networking](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/networking/)\n\n### [Configure DHCP Option 43 for UniFi devices to enable remote adoption across subnets](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/06/unifi-dhcp-option-43/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) June 26, 2024January 18, 2026\n\nHow to configure DHCP Option 43 for UniFi devices \n\n  * [ ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/01/lab-update-part-1-compute/)\n\n[Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/) | [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/)\n\n### [Lab Update – Compute](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/01/lab-update-part-1-compute/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) January 6, 2022July 10, 2024\n\nQuite a few changes have happened in the lab recently. so I decided to do a multipart blog on the changes. The refresh was triggered by the purchase of a SuperMicro Server (2027TR-H71FRF) chassis with 4x X9DRT Nodes / Blades. This is known as a BigTwin configuration in SuperMicro parlance. This is something I was…\n\n  * [Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/) | [Veeam](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/veeam/) | [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/)\n\n### [Lab Update – Desired Workloads](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2022/01/lab-update-part-5-desired-workloads/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) January 6, 2022November 11, 2023\n\nMy lab is always undergoing change. Partially as I want to try new things or new ways of doing things. Sometimes because I break things (not always by accident) sometimes it’s a great way to learn…. I decided to list the workloads I am looking to run (some of these are already in place) Infrastucture…\n\n  * [ ![Nutanix CE](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nutanix-logo-HI-REZ_reverse-w-carrier-768x196.jpg) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2018/01/nutanix-ce/)\n\n[Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/) | [Nutanix](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/nutanix/)\n\n### [Nutanix CE](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2018/01/nutanix-ce/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) January 6, 2018July 10, 2024\n\nI ran a Nutanix CE server at home for a little while when it first came out. However, due to the fairly high requirements, it didn’t make sense to me to continue running it at home. This was compounded by the fact that I have many clusters to play with at work.
