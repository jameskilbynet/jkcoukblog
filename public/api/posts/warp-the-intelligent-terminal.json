It has been a big help for me as although I utilise a lot of linux based tools at home, I am mostly self taught and therefore don’t always use best practices. I also know I take some shortcuts that Is an acceptable risk to me but I strive to do better. Sometimes you just need a helping hand \n\nEnter Warp…\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n## What is Warp?\n\nTaken from Warps website:\n\nBecome a command line power user on day one. Warp combines AI and your dev team’s knowledge in one fast, intuitive terminal.\n\nAt the moment I am just using the free model which has some limits. A number of paid options are available and I am defiantly considering them.\n\n## An example of Warp helping me out \n\nI was running “sudo apt-get update” on one of my servers. This is a server that’s been around the block a bit and runs quite a lot of things and MAY have had some experimentation done in the past :p\n    \n    \n    sudo apt-get update \n    [sudo] password for username: \n    Get:1 file:/var/nvidia-driver-local-repo-ubuntu2404-565.57.01  InRelease [1,572 B]\n    Get:1 file:/var/nvidia-driver-local-repo-ubuntu2404-565.57.01  InRelease [1,572 B]\n    Hit:2 https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/stable/deb/amd64  InRelease\n    Hit:3 https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com noble InRelease                                                                   \n    Hit:4 https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu noble InRelease                                                             \n    Hit:5 http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu noble InRelease                       \n    Get:6 http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu noble-updates InRelease [126 kB]      \n    Hit:7 http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu noble-backports InRelease                          \n    Hit:8 https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt coral-edgetpu-stable InRelease\n    Hit:9 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu noble-security InRelease \n    \n    Fetched 126 kB in 10s (12.0 kB/s)                                                                                                                                                                              \n    Reading package lists...

However as the command (and actual updates) have run successfully in the past I haven’t really dug into it.\n\nWhere the beauty of warp kicked in and said \n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-14.12.14-1024x95.png)\n\nIt then auto executed a cat command to look at the contents of both files and gave me advice based on what it found \n\n![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-14.19.09-1024x137.png)\n\nIt then showed me the below sudo command it wanted to run and asked if it was ok to run it which I approved\n    \n    \n    sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/backdownload_docker_com_linux_ubuntu.list && sudo apt-get update\n    \n\n📋 Copy\n\nOnce apt-get had been upgraded the duplicates were no longer in place and a few updates were available. These were installed and then Warp gave me an excellent summary of what changed:\n\nThe upgrade has been completed successfully. Three packages were upgraded:\n\n  1. pci.ids\n  2. python3-software-properties\n  3. software-properties-common\n\nAccording to the system check:\n\n  * The running kernel is up-to-date\n  * No services need to be restarted\n  * No containers need to be restarted\n  * No user sessions are running outdated binaries\n  * No VM guests are running outdated hypervisor binaries\n\nYour system is now up to date with all the latest package versions.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAlthough the example above is fairly straightforward and I could have resolved myself, using Warp it was fixed MUCH MUCH faster.\n\nI am using it for more and more complex things. Some of these may take a lot of research or are just plain time consuming. Either way I’m finding Warp a great help at making these things faster and more reliable.\n\nIf you like this and want to give Warp a go, sign up with my referral link [here](https://app.warp.dev/referral/48XR9W)\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [How I Migrated from Pocket to Hoarder with AI Integration](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/01/how-i-migrated-from-pocket-to-hoarder-and-introduced-some-ai-along-the-way/)\n  * [Self Hosting AI Stack using vSphere, Docker and NVIDIA GPU](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/10/self-hosting-ai-stack-using-vsphere-docker-and-nvidia-gpu/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![TrueNAS Logo](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-22-at-18.49.21-768x198.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/05/homelab-storage-refresh-part-1/)\n\n[Homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/homelab/) | [Storage](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/storage/)\n\n### [Homelab Storage Refresh (Part 1)](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/05/homelab-storage-refresh-part-1/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) May 23, 2023October 1, 2025\n\nTable of Contents Background ZFS Overview Read Cache (ARC and L2ARC) ZIL (ZFS Intent Log) Hardware Background I have just completed the move of all my production and media-based storage/services to TrueNAS Scale.
