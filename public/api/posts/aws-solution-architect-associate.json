I renewed my AWS Solution Architect certification. Although my work is primarily in and around the VMware ecosystem I have been working a lot with [VMware Cloud on AWS](https://console.cloud.broadcom.com) recently with a number of our customers. Having a good foundation of the core AWS services has made this much easier to be able to articulate to the customers.\n\nDue to the non-disclosure agreement, I can’t talk about any specific questions however I will say that the questions and the focus have changed quite significantly since I sat the exam a few years ago. Like AWS itself they were at the cutting edge of the industry and the number of services they now offer is extreme, adding to the challenge of the exam. I am now good for the next three years however I am planning to sit the Professional level exam in the new year.\n\n## 📚 Related Posts\n\n  * [Monitoring VMC &#8211; Part 1](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2019/12/monitoring-vmc-part-1/)\n  * [AWS Status Page &#8211; Monitoring Included](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2018/05/aws-status-page-monitoring-included/)\n  * [AWS for Beginners](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2018/03/aws-for-beginners1/)\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [VMware](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/vmware/) | [AWS](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/aws/) | [Veeam](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/veeam/)\n\n### [Monitoring VMC – Part 1](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2019/12/monitoring-vmc-part-1/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) December 17, 2019October 1, 2025\n\nAs previously mentioned I have been working a lot with VMware Cloud on AWS and one of the questions that often crops up is around an approach to monitoring.
