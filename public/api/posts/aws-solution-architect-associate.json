I renewed my AWS Solution Architect certification. Although my work is primarily in and around the VMware ecosystem I have been working a lot with [VMware Cloud on AWS](https://console.cloud.broadcom.com) recently with a number of our customers. Having a good foundation of the core AWS services has made this much easier to be able to articulate to the customers.\n\nDue to the non-disclosure agreement, I can’t talk about any specific questions however I will say that the questions and the focus have changed quite significantly since I sat the exam a few years ago. Like AWS itself they were at the cutting edge of the industry and the number of services they now offer is extreme, adding to the challenge of the exam. I am now good for the next three years however I am planning to sit the Professional level exam in the new year.\n\n## Similar Posts\n\n  * [ ![Analytics in a privacy focused world](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/plausible-analytics-icon-top.png) ](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/11/analytics-in-a-privacy-focused-world/)\n\n[Hosting](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/hosting/) | [Personal](https://jameskilby.co.uk/category/personal/)\n\n### [Analytics in a privacy focused world](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2023/11/analytics-in-a-privacy-focused-world/)\n\nBy[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) November 10, 2023October 1, 2025\n\nI recently helped my friend Dean Lewis @veducate with some hosting issues.
