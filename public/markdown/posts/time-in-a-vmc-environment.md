# Time in a VMC Environment

One of the nice things about the VMC Service is that you dont have to worry about a number of the traditional infrastructure services that you typically obsess over when your running your own infrastructure. One of those is Time…. A key requirement for any enterprise platform.

## Table of Contents

## Time

VMC allows you to utilise the Amazon Time Sync Service for keeping an accurate and precise time.

## Firewall Config

To utilise this from a VMC guest perspective, the appropriate NSX firewall rules need to be in place. I.e. on the Compute Gateway, UDP port 123 needs to be available 169.254.169.123

The IP Address is part of the “link local” address range 169.254.0.0/16 and I like that they picked .123 matching the NTP port.

Note: This won’t work over a Route-based VPN with the default route to be on-prem.
