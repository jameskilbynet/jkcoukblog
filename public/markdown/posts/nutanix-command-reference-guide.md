## Nutanix Command List

This is a list of Nutanix commands I have found useful. Its here as a reference and if i need a command more than a few times ill generally add it here.

  * cvm_shutdown -P now ( Correct way to shutdown a CVM)
  * ncc health_checks run_all –parallel=4 . ( 4 is the max number)
