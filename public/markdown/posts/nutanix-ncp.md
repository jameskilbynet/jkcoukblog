I saw a tweet a couple of weeks ago mentioning that Nutanix were offering a free go at the [Nutanix Certified Professional](https://www.nutanix.com/support-services/training-certification/certifications#ncp) exam. They are also offering free on-demand training to go with it. In my current role, I haven’t used Nutanix however I have good experience using it as the storage platform with vSphere and have also run the Nutanix CE software both physically and nested to give me a better overview of the AHV platform.

The online training is delivered over a pretty modern platform and is done in a way to keep you engaged. The Labs aren’t super complicated but are buried in the training as opposed to a separate task. I think I prefer this approach.

This was the first online proctored exam for me so the experience was a bit different. I initially had some issues getting the software to recognise my web camera. After a bit of troubleshooting, this was resolved and the exam began. The questions were fair and followed the blueprint and the time allocated was ample for me.

I wasn’t confident when I pressed the submit button but the results came back instantly and luckily I passed. They also give you a breakdown of how you scored in the various sections this is a really useful piece of feedback that several tests deprive you of.

All in all top work Nutanix
