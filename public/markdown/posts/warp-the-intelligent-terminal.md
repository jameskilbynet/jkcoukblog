# Warp – The intelligent terminal

[Warp](http://warp.dev) is helping me run my homelab. It has been a big help for me as although I utilise a lot of linux based tools at home, I am mostly self taught and therefore don’t always use best practices. I also know I take some shortcuts that Is an acceptable risk to me but I strive to do better. Sometimes you just need a helping hand 

Enter Warp…

## Table of Contents

## What is Warp?

Taken from Warps website:

Become a command line power user on day one. Warp combines AI and your dev team’s knowledge in one fast, intuitive terminal.

At the moment I am just using the free model which has some limits. A number of paid options are available and I am defiantly considering them.

## An example of Warp helping me out 

I was running “sudo apt-get update” on one of my servers. This is a server that’s been around the block a bit and runs quite a lot of things and MAY have had some experimentation done in the past :p

📋 Copy

As you can see the command itself returned some errors about things being configured multiple times. However as the command (and actual updates) have run successfully in the past I haven’t really dug into it.

Where the beauty of warp kicked in and said 

![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-14.12.14-1024x95.png)

It then auto executed a cat command to look at the contents of both files and gave me advice based on what it found 

![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-14.19.09-1024x137.png)

It then showed me the below sudo command it wanted to run and asked if it was ok to run it which I approved
    
    
    sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/backdownload_docker_com_linux_ubuntu.list && sudo apt-get update
    

📋 Copy

Once apt-get had been upgraded the duplicates were no longer in place and a few updates were available. These were installed and then Warp gave me an excellent summary of what changed:

The upgrade has been completed successfully. Three packages were upgraded:

  1. pci.ids
  2. python3-software-properties
  3. software-properties-common

According to the system check:

  * The running kernel is up-to-date
  * No services need to be restarted
  * No containers need to be restarted
  * No user sessions are running outdated binaries
  * No VM guests are running outdated hypervisor binaries

Your system is now up to date with all the latest package versions.

## Conclusion

Although the example above is fairly straightforward and I could have resolved myself, using Warp it was fixed MUCH MUCH faster.

I am using it for more and more complex things. Some of these may take a lot of research or are just plain time consuming. Either way I’m finding Warp a great help at making these things faster and more reliable.

I have been a VMware vExpert for many years and it has brought me many many benefits over the years. I don’t think it’s an understatement to say I probably wouldn’t have my current role within VMware without it. One of the best benefits has been access to a huge amount of licences for VMware…

Artificial intelligence is all the rage at the moment, It’s getting included in every product announcement from pretty much every vendor under the sun. Nvidia’s stock price has gone to the moon. So I thought I better get some knowledge and understand some of this. As it’s a huge field and I wasn’t exactly sure…

Late to the party or not, I have been using containers in my lab more and more and that has led me to Portainer…. I use it for managing the docker containers on my Synology but it can also be used for managing lots of other things. In their own words “Portainer accelerates container adoption….
