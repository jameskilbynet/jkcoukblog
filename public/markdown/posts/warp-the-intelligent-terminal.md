# Warp – The intelligent terminal

[Warp](http://warp.dev) is helping me run my homelab. It has been a big help for me as although I utilise a lot of linux based tools at home, I am mostly self taught and therefore don’t always use best practices. I also know I take some shortcuts that Is an acceptable risk to me but I strive to do better. Sometimes you just need a helping hand 

Enter Warp…

## What is Warp?

Taken from Warps website:

Become a command line power user on day one. Warp combines AI and your dev team’s knowledge in one fast, intuitive terminal.

At the moment I am just using the free model which has some limits. A number of paid options are available and I am defiantly considering them.

## An example of Warp helping me out 

I was running “sudo apt-get update” on one of my servers. This is a server that’s been around the block a bit and runs quite a lot of things and MAY have had some experimentation done in the past :p

📋 Copy

As you can see the command itself returned some errors about things being configured multiple times. However as the command (and actual updates) have run successfully in the past I haven’t really dug into it.

Where the beauty of warp kicked in and said 

![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-14.12.14-1024x95.png)

It then auto executed a cat command to look at the contents of both files and gave me advice based on what it found 

![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-14.19.09-1024x137.png)

It then showed me the below sudo command it wanted to run and asked if it was ok to run it which I approved
    
    
    sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/backdownload_docker_com_linux_ubuntu.list && sudo apt-get update
    

📋 Copy

Once apt-get had been upgraded the duplicates were no longer in place and a few updates were available. These were installed and then Warp gave me an excellent summary of what changed:

The upgrade has been completed successfully. Three packages were upgraded:

  1. pci.ids
  2. python3-software-properties
  3. software-properties-common

According to the system check:

  * The running kernel is up-to-date
  * No services need to be restarted
  * No containers need to be restarted
  * No user sessions are running outdated binaries
  * No VM guests are running outdated hypervisor binaries

Your system is now up to date with all the latest package versions.

## Conclusion

Although the example above is fairly straightforward and I could have resolved myself, using Warp it was fixed MUCH MUCH faster.

I am using it for more and more complex things. Some of these may take a lot of research or are just plain time consuming. Either way I’m finding Warp a great help at making these things faster and more reliable.

I run a reasonably extensive homelab that is of course built around the VMware ecosystem.

I ran a Nutanix CE server at home for a little while when it first came out. However, due to the fairly high requirements, it didn’t make sense to me to continue running it at home. This was compounded by the fact that I have many clusters to play with at work. These all run my…
