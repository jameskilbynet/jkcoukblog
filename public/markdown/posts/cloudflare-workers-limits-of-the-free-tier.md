# Cloudflare Workers – Limits of the free tier

By[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) January 4, 2022April 9, 2023 • 📖1 min read(280 words)

📅 **Published:** January 04, 2022• **Updated:** April 09, 2023

I have been making several changes (mainly cosmetic to this site over the last day or so) On most changes I have been doing an export and then uploading the site to Cloudflare using Wrangler. 

After a while I received an email from Cloudflare saying:

_Hi,_

You’re _50% of the way to reaching one of your daily Cloudflare Workers KV free tier limits. You can view complete usage information in the dashboard._

_If you do not take any action and exceed the daily limit, requests to the Workers KV API will return 429 errors, and operations within a worker will fail until the limit resets at 2022-01-05 at 00:00:00 UTC._

I decided to keep ploughing on with my changes to see what happens when I go over this.

The next email I received was slightly more informative as it said which limit I had breached.

_You have exceeded the daily Cloudflare Workers KV free tier limit of 1000 Workers KV put operations._

When I next tried to publish I got the following 
    
    
    wrangler publish --env production
    ✨  Built successfully, built project size is 13 KiB.
    🌀  Using namespace for Workers Site "__jameskilbycouk-production-workers_sites_assets"
    ✨  Success
    🌀  Uploading site files
    Error: ⚠️  Code 10048: your account has reached the free usage limit for this operation for today

📋 Copy

The same error was observed when running “Wrangler dev”

I had the option of upgrading for the cost of $5 which includes a very generous 10 million read operations and 1 million each of write, delete and list operations however it’s just not worth it for this site. I will wait until tomorrow to publish.

Detailed info on the limits is published [here ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits)

A lot of these are in “the backend” These help improve the performance, Privacy, SEO, and I have also added some security best practices. Most of these changes were done more as an exercise than due to a specific requirement. I also had…
