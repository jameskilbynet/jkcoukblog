# How to Fix Portainer Agent not Starting On Synology DSM

By[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) March 11, 2025December 27, 2025 • 📖2 min read(412 words)

Intro:

This is a really quick post for any one wanting to manage docker deployments on a Synology using Portainer hosted elsewhere.

I have been using [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io) as my homelab container management for a few years now. I wanted to extend this management to one of my Synology NAS devices as I had plans to run a few containers on them (away from my main VMware Cluster) At present Portainer runs in a Docker VM direct on my [TrueNAS](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/09/can-you-really-squeeze-96tb-in-1u/) box

## Table of Contents

## Setup

When logged into Portainer, the first thing we are going to do is add another environment. This is done by navigating to the environments section. I am lucky enough to have a 5 node Business licence for this purpose.

This will navigate you to the list of existing environments, where you can add an additional environment

![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/environment-List-1024x166.png)

The wizard will then ask you what environment you would like to create. In my case it will be a Docker Standalone

![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/environment-Type-1024x301.png)

Once you have chosen Docker you have to name the environment and tell Portainer the address remembering the port (9001)

Portainer then gives you the command to execute on the remote environment to fire up the Portainer Agent for the Portainer server to connect to.

## Issue

When I SSH into my Synology to run the commands I get the below error
    
    
     sudo docker run -d \
    >   -p 9001:9001 \
    >   --name portainer_agent \
    >   --restart=always \
    >   -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    >   -v /var/lib/docker/volumes:/var/lib/docker/volumes \
    >   -v /:/host \
    >   portainer/agent:2.27.1
    
    We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
    Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:
    
        #1) Respect the privacy of others.
        #2) Think before you type.
        #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

## The Fix

This occurs as /var/lib/docker/volumes does not exist on the Synology Filesystem. If we update the command as below the container starts successfully.
    
    
    sudo docker run -d -p 9001:9001 --name portainer_agent --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /volume1/@docker/volumes:/var/lib/docker/volumes portainer/agent

Artificial intelligence is all the rage at the moment, It’s getting included in every product announcement from pretty much every vendor under the sun. Nvidia’s stock price has gone to the moon.
