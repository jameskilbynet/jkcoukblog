I decided it was about time I replaced my trusted MacBook Air that I purchased back in 2011. After waiting and watching the Apple announcements over the last couple of years I decided the MacBook Pro’s weren’t worth it. So I have replaced my Air with yes you guessed it another [MacBook Air](https://www.apple.com/uk/macbook-air/).

This time I went for the retina version with 16Gb of RAM and 512GB PCIe-based SSD. The spec was certainly good enough for 99% of my needs yet still being lighter and with better battery life than a MacBook Pro. It also has the security benefits of the [T2 Security chip](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208862)

I also thought it was time to tidy up and publish my Mac build scripts for anyone else to use. They are available below and hopefully pretty easy for anyone to follow.

I have slowly morphed into an Apple fanboy over the last decade or so collecting a large number of devices ever since my first MacBook Air back in 2011. When you’re in the ecosystem additional devices just make sense….. I currently have: My Wife also has All in all a lot of apple devices need…
