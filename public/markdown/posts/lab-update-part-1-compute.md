# Lab Update – Compute

Quite a few changes have happened in the lab recently. so I decided to do a multipart blog on the changes.

The refresh was triggered by the purchase of a SuperMicro Server ([2027TR-H71FRF](https://www.supermicro.com/products/system/2U/2027/SYS-2027TR-H71FRF.cfm)) chassis with 4x X9DRT Nodes / Blades. This is known as a BigTwin configuration in SuperMicro parlance. This is something I was very familiar with as most of the Nutanix nodes that we deployed at Zen were of this design.

Each node has 2x Intel Xeon CPU E5-2670 @ 2.60GHz 3 Nodes have 192GB of RAM and 1 has 128GB giving a combined 64c/128t and 704GB of RAM. Quite an amount to be squeezed into 2U.

This is a huge uplift in compute resources so is more than welcome. I also decided to put what I could in a proper rack and purchased a Startech 25U rack to mount it.

The plan is also to make a serious network investment (to move me away from 1Gb) but I haven’t completely decided what that will look like. This will likely be the final investment for a while.

With the additional Supermicro compute available I have made the Z840 a sort of standalone node. I will keep it around as it’s the only thing capable of running my Nvidia K2.

My lab is always undergoing change. Partially as I want to try new things or new ways of doing things. Sometimes because I break things (not always by accident) sometimes it’s a great way to learn…. I decided to list the workloads I am looking to run (some of these are already in place) Infrastucture…

There is a lot of uncertainty with VMware at the moment. This is all due to the pending acquisition by Broadcom. There are a lot of unknowns for the staff and customers about what the company will look like in the future. I certainly have some concerns mainly just with the unknown. However, VMware has…

I run a reasonably extensive homelab that is of course built around the VMware ecosystem. So with the release of vSphere 8 I was obviously going to upgrade however a few personal things blocked me from doing it until now. The vCenter upgrade was smooth however knowing that some of the hardware I am running…
