# Lab Update – Compute

Quite a few changes have happened in the lab recently. so I decided to do a multipart blog on the changes.

The refresh was triggered by the purchase of a SuperMicro Server ([2027TR-H71FRF](https://www.supermicro.com/products/system/2U/2027/SYS-2027TR-H71FRF.cfm)) chassis with 4x X9DRT Nodes / Blades. This is known as a BigTwin configuration in SuperMicro parlance. This is something I was very familiar with as most of the Nutanix nodes that we deployed at Zen were of this design.

Each node has 2x Intel Xeon CPU E5-2670 @ 2.60GHz 3 Nodes have 192GB of RAM and 1 has 128GB giving a combined 64c/128t and 704GB of RAM. Quite an amount to be squeezed into 2U.

This is a huge uplift in compute resources so is more than welcome. I also decided to put what I could in a proper rack and purchased a Startech 25U rack to mount it.

The plan is also to make a serious network investment (to move me away from 1Gb) but I haven’t completely decided what that will look like. This will likely be the final investment for a while.

With the additional Supermicro compute available I have made the Z840 a sort of standalone node. I will keep it around as it’s the only thing capable of running my Nvidia K2.

For a while, I’ve been looking to update the networking at the core of my homelab. I have had some great results with the current setup utilising a number of DAC’s but there were a couple of things that were annoying me. Then MikroTik dropped the CRS504-4XQ-IN and if the price wasn’t horrendous then that…

I recently sat (and passed the VMware HCI Master Specialist exam (5V0-21.20). I won’t go into any details of the contents but I will comment that I felt the questions were fair and that there wasn’t anything in it to trip you up. The required knowledge was certainly wider than the vSAN specialist exam. This…

Lab Storage Update. Since starting my new role with Xtravirt my Homelab has gone through several fairly significant changes. At the moment it’s very much focused on the VMware stack and one of the things I needed was some more storage and especially some more storage performance. With that in mind, I purchased a new Synology…
