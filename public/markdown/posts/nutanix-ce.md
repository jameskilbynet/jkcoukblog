# Nutanix CE

I ran a Nutanix CE server at home for a little while when it first came out. However, due to the fairly high requirements, it didn’t make sense to me to continue running it at home. This was compounded by the fact that I have many clusters to play with at work. These all run my Hypervisor of choice vSphere so I thought it was about time to see what was new with AHV and Nutanix CE

I downloaded the latest copy of CE from the Nutanix site and extracted it to a USB stick with [Rufus.](https://rufus.akeo.ie/) (This took about 30 mins)

The server that I chose to run this on was the same server I ran initially. a Dell T20 with the Xeon processor 32GB of RAM 1x240GB SSD and 1x3TB WD Red. The installation is pretty straightforward and covered a lot elsewhere.

I am just kicking the tyres with it at the moment and running a few VM’s. I have also shared the storage from my Nutanix CE setup back to my vSphere environment.

Ill post back with some updates of what I get up to with it

Lab Storage Update. Since starting my new role with Xtravirt my Homelab has gone through several fairly significant changes. At the moment it’s very much focused on the VMware stack and one of the things I needed was some more storage and especially some more storage performance. With that in mind, I purchased a new Synology…

I have retired the WatchGuard Devices with the migration to PFSense running bare-metal in one of the Supermicro Nodes. I will likely virtualise this in the future. In terms of network/switching I have moved to an intermediate step here vMotion and Storage are running over DAC’s while VMware management and VM traffic is still over…

Then MikroTik dropped the CRS504-4XQ-IN and if the price wasn’t horrendous then that…
