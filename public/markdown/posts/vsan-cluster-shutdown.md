As can be seen on my Lab Overview page. I have a GPU/Management cluster that is usually running 24×7. I also have a 3x Node vSAN cluster that I use when I need more resources (or specifically if I need vSAN to test with)

This allows me to 

See the overview below

And there you have it…

To restart the cluster, ensure all the hosts are booted. Leave them in maintenance mode and then select “Restart vSAN Services” The workflow will enable them to bring them back into operation.
