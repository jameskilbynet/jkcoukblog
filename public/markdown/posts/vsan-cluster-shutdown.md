As can be seen on my Lab Overview page. I have a GPU/Management cluster that is usually running 24×7. I also have a 3x Node vSAN cluster that I use when I need more resources (or specifically if I need vSAN to test with)

This allows me to 

See the overview below

To shut down a vSAN cluster, there is a nice workflow built into vCentre that will orchestrate all the required actions for you
