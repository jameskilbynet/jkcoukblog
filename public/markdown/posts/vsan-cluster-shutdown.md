As can be seen on my Lab Overview page. I have a GPU/Management cluster that is usually running 24×7. I also have a 3x Node vSAN cluster that I use when I need more resources (or specifically if I need vSAN to test with)

This allows me to

To shut down a vSAN cluster, there is a nice workflow built into vCentre that will orchestrate all the required actions for you

And there you have it…

To restart the cluster, ensure all the hosts are booted. Leave them in maintenance mode and then select “Restart vSAN Services” The workflow will enable them to bring them back into operation.

I recently sat (and passed the VMware HCI Master Specialist exam (5V0-21.20). I won’t go into any details of the contents but I will comment that I felt the questions were fair and that there wasn’t anything in it to trip you up. The required knowledge was certainly wider than the vSAN specialist exam. This…

VMware Cloud on AWS (VMC) has introduced a new host to its lineup the “i3en”. This is based on the i3en.metal AWS instance. The specifications are certainly impressive packing in 96 logical cores, 768GiB RAM, and approximately 45.84 TiB of NVMe raw storage capacity per host. It’s certainly a monster with a 266% uplift in…

There is a lot of uncertainty with VMware at the moment. This is all due to the pending acquisition by Broadcom. There are a lot of unknowns for the staff and customers about what the company will look like in the future. I certainly have some concerns mainly just with the unknown. However, VMware has…
