As can be seen on my Lab Overview page. I have a GPU/Management cluster that is usually running 24×7. I also have a 3x Node vSAN cluster that I use when I need more resources (or specifically if I need vSAN to test with)

This allows me to 

See the overview below

To shut down a vSAN cluster, there is a nice workflow built into vCentre that will orchestrate all the required actions for you

And there you have it…

To restart the cluster, ensure all the hosts are booted. Leave them in maintenance mode and then select “Restart vSAN Services” The workflow will enable them to bring them back into operation.

A little while ago I decided to play with vGPU in my homelab. This was something I had dabbled with in the past but never really had the time or need to get working properly. The first thing that I needed was a GPU. I did have a Dell T20 with an iGPU built into…

I run a reasonably extensive homelab that is of course built around the VMware ecosystem. So with the release of vSphere 8 I was obviously going to upgrade however a few personal things blocked me from doing it until now. The vCenter upgrade was smooth however knowing that some of the hardware I am running…

I recently sat (and passed the VMware HCI Master Specialist exam (5V0-21.20). I won’t go into any details of the contents but I will comment that I felt the questions were fair and that there wasn’t anything in it to trip you up. The required knowledge was certainly wider than the vSAN specialist exam. This…
