# Lab Storage

I have been meaning to post around some of the lab setup for a while. Although it changes frequently at present it’s as below. I will add some pics when I have tidied up the lab/cables

My primary lab storage is all contained within an HP Gen8 Microserver.

Currently Configured:

1x INTEL Core i3-4130 running at 2.3Ghz

16Gb of RAM

4x 1Gb/s NIC

2x 3TB WD Red

2x Intel SSD 320 Series 80GB, 25nm MLC

This is running Xpenology.

I have the 4 Nics split into two LACP bonds. One for the management traffic and one for pure NFS traffic.

The 2xWD Red’s are in an SHR configuration with the SSDs running as a SSD read-write cache

This gives me 2.6TB Useable which is plenty to lab and store photos and media and with the RW cache, the perf is pretty dam good.

I also have a DS216+II Synology with 2x 2TB WD Red’s this is my tier 2 lab storage. for backups ISO’s etc

I am running a few apps/containers on the Xpenology install as it has a lot more ram/processing power.

At the moment this consists of:

Docker – GitLab

Docker – PHPipam

Plex

Yes, that’s a clickbait title. But technically it’s possible if I dropped all drive redundancy… I recently saw an advert for a server that was just too good to be true. It promised to bring a huge amount of storage and future options in a quite hard-to-believe 1U. The price it was on offer for…

The HP Z840 has changed its role to a permanent storage box running Truenas Scale. This is in addition to my Synology DS918+ TrueNas is the successor to FreeNas a very popular BSD based StorageOS and TrueNas scale is a fork of this based on Linux. The Synology has been an amazing piece of kit…

Late to the party or not, I have been using containers in my lab more and more and that has led me to Portainer…. I use it for managing the docker containers on my Synology but it can also be used for managing lots of other things. In their own words “Portainer accelerates container adoption….
