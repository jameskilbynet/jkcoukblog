# Lab Storage

I have been meaning to post around some of the lab setup for a while. Although it changes frequently at present it’s as below. I will add some pics when I have tidied up the lab/cables

My primary lab storage is all contained within an HP Gen8 Microserver.

Currently Configured:

1x INTEL Core i3-4130 running at 2.3Ghz

16Gb of RAM

4x 1Gb/s NIC

2x 3TB WD Red

2x Intel SSD 320 Series 80GB, 25nm MLC

This is running Xpenology.

I have the 4 Nics split into two LACP bonds. One for the management traffic and one for pure NFS traffic.

The 2xWD Red’s are in an SHR configuration with the SSDs running as a SSD read-write cache

This gives me 2.6TB Useable which is plenty to lab and store photos and media and with the RW cache, the perf is pretty dam good.

I also have a DS216+II Synology with 2x 2TB WD Red’s this is my tier 2 lab storage. for backups ISO’s etc

I am running a few apps/containers on the Xpenology install as it has a lot more ram/processing power.

At the moment this consists of:

Docker – GitLab

Docker – PHPipam

Plex

Quite a few changes have happened in the lab recently. so I decided to do a multipart blog on the changes. The refresh was triggered by the purchase of a SuperMicro Server (2027TR-H71FRF) chassis with 4x X9DRT Nodes / Blades. This is known as a BigTwin configuration in SuperMicro parlance. This is something I was…

Lab Storage Update. Since starting my new role with Xtravirt my Homelab has gone through several fairly significant changes. At the moment it’s very much focused on the VMware stack and one of the things I needed was some more storage and especially some more storage performance. With that in mind, I purchased a new Synology…

Yes, that’s a clickbait title. But technically it’s possible if I dropped all drive redundancy… I recently saw an advert for a server that was just too good to be true. It promised to bring a huge amount of storage and future options in a quite hard-to-believe 1U. The price it was on offer for…

For a while, I’ve been looking to update the networking at the core of my homelab. I have had some great results with the current setup utilising a number of DAC’s but there were a couple of things that were annoying me. Then MikroTik dropped the CRS504-4XQ-IN and if the price wasn’t horrendous then that…
