Packer is one of those tools I have heard about, and some of the cool people on Twitter that I follow have been using it for a while. But until now I had never played with it. That was until I saw the below tweet by the legend that is [William Lam](https://williamlam.com/)

That was the kicker I needed to go and have a look at getting it set up and running. As I run a Mac as my main machine it was easy to get deployed following the instructions using [brew](https://brew.sh) and the GitHub Repo that William had pointed to.

However, once I had added my vSphere credentials I was having a few issues. On execution, I was getting the error message “default datacenter resolves to multiple instances” I did a bit of digging and discovered that the code didn’t specify a VMware datacenter and in my lab environment, I have 2 physical sites with a VMware datacenter in each, therefore, I needed to specify which one. Once this was fixed I started rolling out some Linux templates and it worked flawlessly until I got to the photon 4 server. I again spotted a typo and a syntax error on a command being passed into the photon VM. I corrected this and decided that actually, I should work out how to get this fixed upstream to help the wider community.

Once this was working it was onto the Windows templates. Once all the relevant ISO’s and configs were in place I was able to fully deploy 4 Windows servers that were patched and added to my content library in about 40mins. So whenever I go to deploy an Image it is always up to date…

Thanks to [Ryan](https://github.com/tenthirtyam) for an Incredible piece of work

As previously mentioned I have been working a lot with VMware Cloud on AWS and one of the questions that often crops up is around an approach to monitoring. This is an interesting topic as VMC is technically “as a service” therefore the monitoring approach is a bit different. Technically AWS and VMware’s SRE teams…

Late to the party or not, I have been using containers in my lab more and more and that has led me to Portainer…. I use it for managing the docker containers on my Synology but it can also be used for managing lots of other things. In their own words “Portainer accelerates container adoption….

I run a reasonably extensive homelab that is of course built around the VMware ecosystem. So with the release of vSphere 8 I was obviously going to upgrade however a few personal things blocked me from doing it until now. The vCenter upgrade was smooth however knowing that some of the hardware I am running…
