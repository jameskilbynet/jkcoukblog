# VMware – Going out with a Bang!

There is a lot of uncertainty with VMware at the moment. This is all due to the pending acquisition by Broadcom. There are a lot of unknowns for the staff and customers about what the company will look like in the future. I certainly have some concerns mainly just with the unknown. However, VMware has a great reputation for doing the right thing around its staff, customers, and the wider world. 

Yesterday the entire company was off on one of VMware’s so-called [EPIC](https://news.vmware.com/company/vmwares-culture-built-epic2-values) days. I spent the day with my family on the beach.

VMware also gave all employees $1300 dollars for donation through their foundation to a charity of your choice. I decided to give mine to the [RNLI](https://rnli.org). Being based in Poole for the last couple of years and having a friend who volunteers for the RNLI in Ireland, I thought they were a great recipient of this very generous donation from VMware.

A little while ago I decided to play with vGPU in my homelab. This was something I had dabbled with in the past but never really had the time or need to get working properly. The first thing that I needed was a GPU. I did have a Dell T20 with an iGPU built into…

I have been a VMware vExpert for many years and it has brought me many many benefits over the years. I don’t think it’s an understatement to say I probably wouldn’t have my current role within VMware without it. One of the best benefits has been access to a huge amount of licences for VMware…

I recently sat (and passed the VMware HCI Master Specialist exam (5V0-21.20). I won’t go into any details of the contents but I will comment that I felt the questions were fair and that there wasn’t anything in it to trip you up. The required knowledge was certainly wider than the vSAN specialist exam. This…
