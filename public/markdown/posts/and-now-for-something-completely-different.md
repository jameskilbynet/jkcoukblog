# And now for something completely different

By[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) October 16, 2018July 10, 2024 • 📖1 min read(263 words)

I have worked for my current employer [Zen Internet](https://www.zen.co.uk/) for 3.5 years. Over that time I have changed roles from what was originally a customer-focused role into a role with one of the core platform teams. This has meant looking after the majority of the Internal and customer Virtual platforms. During this time Zen has undergone several large migration programs and countless smaller ones. Some of the big ones include:

  * [Core ISP network refresh](https://www.zen.co.uk/blog/posts/zen-blog/2018/02/09/how-plexus-came-about)
  * [Microsegmentation rollout](https://www.vmware.com/uk/products/nsx.html)
  * [Nutanix integration](https://www.zen.co.uk/large-business/products-solutions/cloud-hosting)
  * Backup Consolidation

I have been lucky enough to be involved with all of these ( some much more than others) Although the work is never complete Zen are in a good place.

At the same time, my personal circumstances have changed somewhat. My upcoming wedding and my fiancé not knowing exactly where she will be based meant having the freedom to be located anywhere (within reason) was a huge win for me.

I was also looking for a role challenging me using some of the toolsets that I love but also being on the cutting edge of the various stacks.

And with that – I am proud to say I am joining one of the big hitters, awarded both the EMEA and Global VMware Partner Innovation Award for professional services in 2018

Yes, I’m Joining [Xtravirt](https://xtravirt.com/) as a Senior Consultant.

This should allow me to utilize and improve my core VMware knowledge but also leverage some of my other skills including Veeam, Nutanix and AWS. Something I’m looking forward to. I also get to work with Chris Lewis, Simon Eady and one or two others…..

A while ago I started messing with Cloudflare Workers. I have now moved this site permanently over to them. This is partly related to some issues I have been having with internet access at home. Prior to this, the site ran from within my lab. This means the site is now super fast (hopefully :p)….

I recently sat (and passed the VMware HCI Master Specialist exam (5V0-21.20). I won’t go into any details of the contents but I will comment that I felt the questions were fair and that there wasn’t anything in it to trip you up. The required knowledge was certainly wider than the vSAN specialist exam. This…

There are a lot of unknowns for the staff and customers about what the company will look like in the future. I certainly have some concerns mainly just with the unknown. However, VMware has…
