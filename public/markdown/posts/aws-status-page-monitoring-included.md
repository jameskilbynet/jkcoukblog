# AWS Status Page – Monitoring Included

## **AWS Status Page – Enhancements**

The tool I deployed [lambstatus](https://lambstatus.github.io/get-started/) supports pulling metrics from AWS Cloudwatch and displaying them. As part of my personal development, I thought I would include this on my status page.

I managed to get this working as can be seen [here. ](https://d1wijjwc03zzo1.cloudfront.net)This is a lambda function running once a minute polling this website and adding the response time into AWS Cloudwatch which Lambstatus is allowed to call. It has been running without a hitch for nearly a month now at **effectively zero cost**

#### Site Response

The guide I followed is very good and is documented in the Git repo [here](https://lambstatus.github.io/set-up-custom-http-s-monitoring/)
