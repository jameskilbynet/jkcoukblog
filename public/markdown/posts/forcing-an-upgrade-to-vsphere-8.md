# Forcing an Upgrade to vSphere 8

I run a reasonably extensive [homelab](https://jameskilby.co.uk/lab/) that is of course built around the VMware ecosystem. So with the release of vSphere 8 I was obviously going to upgrade however a few personal things blocked me from doing it until now. The vCenter upgrade was smooth however knowing that some of the hardware I am running is a little dated this was always going to carry a risk.

I tried using lifecycle manager (vLCM) within vCenter but I was faced with the following and I couldn’t see a way to force remediate from within vCenter. Therefore I resorted to doing it from the command line.

Firstly enable SSH on each of the hosts to be upgraded

Then Allow HTTP traffic in the ESXi firewall
    
    
    esxcli network firewall ruleset set -e true -r httpClient

📋 Copy

The next step is to list the available ESXi profiles using the online depot. In my case, I was looking for ESXi 8.0a
    
    
    esxcli software sources profile list -d https://hostupdate.vmware.com/software/VUM/PRODUCTION/main/vmw-depot-index.xml | grep -i ESXi-8.0a

📋 Copy

Then comes the Install, I had validated that this would be ok by installing from USB to another node. All of the hardware that I needed continued to work as expected with the only significant loss being Mellanox Connect X-3 40Gb/s adaptor. 
    
    
    esxcli software profile update -p ESXi-8.0a-20842819-standard -d https://hostupdate.vmware.com/software/VUM/PRODUCTION/main/vmw-depot-index.xml --no-hardware-warning

📋 Copy

Update Result

Message: The update completed successfully, but the system needs to be rebooted for the changes to be effective. Reboot Required: true

It also listed all of the newly installed VIB’s 

The last step is to disable the firewall rule and then SSH 
    
    
     esxcli network firewall ruleset set -e false -r httpClient

There is a lot of uncertainty with VMware at the moment. This is all due to the pending acquisition by Broadcom.

Artificial intelligence is all the rage at the moment, It’s getting included in every product announcement from pretty much every vendor under the sun. Nvidia’s stock price has gone to the moon. So I thought I better get some knowledge and understand some of this. As it’s a huge field and I wasn’t exactly sure…

Lab Storage Update. Since starting my new role with Xtravirt my Homelab has gone through several fairly significant changes. At the moment it’s very much focused on the VMware stack and one of the things I needed was some more storage and especially some more storage performance. With that in mind, I purchased a new Synology…

I have been a VMware vExpert for many years and it has brought me many many benefits over the years. I don’t think it’s an understatement to say I probably wouldn’t have my current role within VMware without it. One of the best benefits has been access to a huge amount of licences for VMware…
