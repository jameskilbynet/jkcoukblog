This is a quick reference guide to the available storage resources that you get in VMware Cloud on AWS depending on the host type in use.

For up to date info always use the official sizing tool located [here ](https://vmc.vmware.com/)

This is based on vSAN OSA and excluding the management overhead (Ie valid for secondary clusters) It also uses the most efficient storage policy that is supported based on the number of hosts available.

If you are planning to do a cluster conversion between host types then the management stack size doesn’t change.

Host Type| i3| i3en| I4i|   
---|---|---|---|---  
No of Hosts| i3 (TiB)| i3en (TiB)| I4i (TiB)| FTT in use  
2| 11.2| 41.39| 18.48| FTT1 RAID1  
3| 16.8| 62.09| 27.71| FTT1 RAID1  
4| 33.68| 124.49| 55.57| FTT1 RAID5

There is a lot of uncertainty with VMware at the moment. This is all due to the pending acquisition by Broadcom.
