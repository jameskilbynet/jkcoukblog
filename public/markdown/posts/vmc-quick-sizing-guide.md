# VMC Quick Sizing Guide

This is a quick reference guide to the available storage resources that you get in VMware Cloud on AWS depending on the host type in use.

For up to date info always use the official sizing tool located [here ](https://vmc.vmware.com/)

This is based on vSAN OSA and excluding the management overhead (Ie valid for secondary clusters) It also uses the most efficient storage policy that is supported based on the number of hosts available.

If you are planning to do a cluster conversion between host types then the management stack size doesn’t change.

Host Type| i3| i3en| I4i|   
---|---|---|---|---  
No of Hosts| i3 (TiB)| i3en (TiB)| I4i (TiB)| FTT in use  
2| 11.2| 41.39| 18.48| FTT1 RAID1  
3| 16.8| 62.09| 27.71| FTT1 RAID1  
4| 33.68| 124.49| 55.57| FTT1 RAID5  
5| 42.1| 155.61| 69.46| FTT1 RAID5  
6| 44.8| 165.57| 73.9| FTT2 RAID6  
7| 52.26| 193.17| 86.22| FTT2 RAID6  
8| 59.73| 220.77| 98.54| FTT2 RAID6  
9| 67.2| 248.36| 110.85| FTT2 RAID6  
10| 74.66| 275.96| 123.17| FTT2 RAID6  
11| 82.13| 303.55| 135.49| FTT2 RAID6  
12| 89.6| 331.15| 147.8| FTT2 RAID6  
13| 97.06| 358.74| 160.12| FTT2 RAID6  
14| 104.53| 386.34| 172.44| FTT2 RAID6  
15| 112| 413.94| 184.75| FTT2 RAID6

Quite a few changes have happened in the lab recently. so I decided to do a multipart blog on the changes.

This is something I was…
