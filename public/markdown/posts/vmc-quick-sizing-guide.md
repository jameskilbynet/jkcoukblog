# VMC Quick Sizing Guide

This is a quick reference guide to the available storage resources that you get in VMware Cloud on AWS depending on the host type in use.

For up to date info always use the official sizing tool located [here ](https://vmc.vmware.com/)

This is based on vSAN OSA and excluding the management overhead (Ie valid for secondary clusters) It also uses the most efficient storage policy that is supported based on the number of hosts available.

If you are planning to do a cluster conversion between host types then the management stack size doesn’t change.

Host Type| i3| i3en| I4i|   
---|---|---|---|---  
No of Hosts| i3 (TiB)| i3en (TiB)| I4i (TiB)| FTT in use  
2| 11.2| 41.39| 18.48| FTT1 RAID1  
3| 16.8| 62.09| 27.71| FTT1 RAID1  
4| 33.68| 124.49| 55.57| FTT1 RAID5  
5| 42.1| 155.61| 69.46| FTT1 RAID5  
6| 44.8| 165.57| 73.9| FTT2 RAID6  
7| 52.26| 193.17| 86.22| FTT2 RAID6  
8| 59.73| 220.77| 98.54| FTT2 RAID6  
9| 67.2| 248.36| 110.85| FTT2 RAID6  
10| 74.66| 275.96| 123.17| FTT2 RAID6  
11| 82.13| 303.55| 135.49| FTT2 RAID6  
12| 89.6| 331.15| 147.8| FTT2 RAID6  
13| 97.06| 358.74| 160.12| FTT2 RAID6  
14| 104.53| 386.34| 172.44| FTT2 RAID6  
15| 112| 413.94| 184.75| FTT2 RAID6

VMware Cloud on AWS (VMC) has introduced a new host to its lineup the “i3en”. This is based on the i3en.metal AWS instance. The specifications are certainly impressive packing in 96 logical cores, 768GiB RAM, and approximately 45.84 TiB of NVMe raw storage capacity per host. It’s certainly a monster with a 266% uplift in…
