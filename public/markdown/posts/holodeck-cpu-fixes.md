# Holodeck CPU Fixes

By[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) January 18, 2024July 10, 2024 • 📖1 min read(268 words)

Disclaimer: This is **not** a supported configuration by the Holodeck team please don’t reach out to them for help. No support will be given for running cpu’s without the required feature sets.

## Table of Contents

In my [previous post](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/01/multihost-holodeck-vcf/) about my Holodeck experience, I mentioned that I had some issues due to the age of the Physical CPU’s in the hosts that I was using to run Holodeck. This error will manifest itself in three places during the deployment.

  * Nested ESX Power On
  * vCLS machine deployment
  * NSX Edge deployment

## Nested ESX Power On

Obviously, my CPU’s are not supported for ESXi 8.0.1 and when the host is powered on you will see the image below. 

![ESXi unsupported error](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-27-at-12.55.09.png)

Just like with a physical host, it is possible to override this. 

This is done by adding 
    
    
    --ignoreprereqwarnings --ignoreprereqerrors --forceunsupportedinstall

📋 Copy

to the VLCGUI.ps1 script.

For the same reasons when the cluster is built and the vCLS VM’s for DRS are deployed, they will fail to power on. 

## NSX Edge

![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-02-at-14.28.25.png)

And last of all when the NSX edges attempt to power on they will fail due to the lack of a feature in the CPU called 1G huge page support. These issues can manifest when deploying NSX outside of VCF so a lot has been written about these issues and how to overcome them.

## Solution

Luckily a colleague of mine Tim Sommer has made all of the required changes to the VLCGUI.ps1 deployment script and that is available [here ](https://ent.box.com/s/u4wiwh2mq8o05ct8e67ndapvxhudkhe2)

I have tried this multiple times and I have had a 100% success rate with the deployment with no manual fixes being required.

I run a reasonably extensive homelab that is of course built around the VMware ecosystem. So with the release of vSphere 8 I was obviously going to upgrade however a few personal things blocked me from doing it until now. The vCenter upgrade was smooth however knowing that some of the hardware I am running…

For a while, I’ve been looking to update the networking at the core of my homelab. I have had some great results with the current setup utilising a number of DAC’s but there were a couple of things that were annoying me. Then MikroTik dropped the CRS504-4XQ-IN and if the price wasn’t horrendous then that…

There is a lot of uncertainty with VMware at the moment. This is all due to the pending acquisition by Broadcom.
