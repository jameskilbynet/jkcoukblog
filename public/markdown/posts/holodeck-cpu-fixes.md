# Holodeck CPU Fixes

By[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) January 18, 2024July 10, 2024 • 📖1 min read(268 words)

Disclaimer: This is **not** a supported configuration by the Holodeck team please don’t reach out to them for help. No support will be given for running cpu’s without the required feature sets.

## Table of Contents

In my [previous post](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/01/multihost-holodeck-vcf/) about my Holodeck experience, I mentioned that I had some issues due to the age of the Physical CPU’s in the hosts that I was using to run Holodeck. This error will manifest itself in three places during the deployment.

  * Nested ESX Power On
  * vCLS machine deployment
  * NSX Edge deployment

## Nested ESX Power On

Obviously, my CPU’s are not supported for ESXi 8.0.1 and when the host is powered on you will see the image below. 

![ESXi unsupported error](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-27-at-12.55.09.png)

Just like with a physical host, it is possible to override this. 

This is done by adding 
    
    
    --ignoreprereqwarnings --ignoreprereqerrors --forceunsupportedinstall

📋 Copy

to the VLCGUI.ps1 script.

For the same reasons when the cluster is built and the vCLS VM’s for DRS are deployed, they will fail to power on. 

## NSX Edge

![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-02-at-14.28.25.png)

And last of all when the NSX edges attempt to power on they will fail due to the lack of a feature in the CPU called 1G huge page support. These issues can manifest when deploying NSX outside of VCF so a lot has been written about these issues and how to overcome them.

## Solution

Luckily a colleague of mine Tim Sommer has made all of the required changes to the VLCGUI.ps1 deployment script and that is available [here ](https://ent.box.com/s/u4wiwh2mq8o05ct8e67ndapvxhudkhe2)

I have tried this multiple times and I have had a 100% success rate with the deployment with no manual fixes being required.

Artificial intelligence is all the rage at the moment, It’s getting included in every product announcement from pretty much every vendor under the sun. Nvidia’s stock price has gone to the moon.

I have retired the WatchGuard Devices with the migration to PFSense running bare-metal in one of the Supermicro Nodes. I will likely virtualise this in the future. In terms of network/switching I have moved to an intermediate step here vMotion and Storage are running over DAC’s while VMware management and VM traffic is still over…

Lab Storage Update. Since starting my new role with Xtravirt my Homelab has gone through several fairly significant changes. At the moment it’s very much focused on the VMware stack and one of the things I needed was some more storage and especially some more storage performance. With that in mind, I purchased a new Synology…

Yes, that’s a clickbait title. But technically it’s possible if I dropped all drive redundancy… I recently saw an advert for a server that was just too good to be true. It promised to bring a huge amount of storage and future options in a quite hard-to-believe 1U. The price it was on offer for…
