## Table of Contents

I have very much fallen down the rabbit hole with TrueNAS and although the GUI is very good occasionally I need to jump to the command line. This is a list of the commands that I might need to use. I will update this page with anything else I find useful. 

## General Storage

    sudo zfs get compressratio  $PoolName

## Application

    curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Heavybullets8/heavy_script/main/functions/deploy.sh | bash && source "$HOME/.bashrc" 2>/dev/null && source "$HOME/.zshrc" 2>/dev/null

Late to the party or not, I have been using containers in my lab more and more and that has led me to Portainer…. I use it for managing the docker containers on my Synology but it can also be used for managing lots of other things. In their own words “Portainer accelerates container adoption….

Yes, that’s a clickbait title. But technically it’s possible if I dropped all drive redundancy… I recently saw an advert for a server that was just too good to be true. It promised to bring a huge amount of storage and future options in a quite hard-to-believe 1U. The price it was on offer for…
