# Lab Update – Compute

Quite a few changes have happened in the lab recently. so I decided to do a multipart blog on the changes.

The refresh was triggered by the purchase of a SuperMicro Server ([2027TR-H71FRF](https://www.supermicro.com/products/system/2U/2027/SYS-2027TR-H71FRF.cfm)) chassis with 4x X9DRT Nodes / Blades. This is known as a BigTwin configuration in SuperMicro parlance. This is something I was very familiar with as most of the Nutanix nodes that we deployed at Zen were of this design.

Each node has 2x Intel Xeon CPU E5-2670 @ 2.60GHz 3 Nodes have 192GB of RAM and 1 has 128GB giving a combined 64c/128t and 704GB of RAM. Quite an amount to be squeezed into 2U.

This is a huge uplift in compute resources so is more than welcome. I also decided to put what I could in a proper rack and purchased a Startech 25U rack to mount it.

The plan is also to make a serious network investment (to move me away from 1Gb) but I haven’t completely decided what that will look like. This will likely be the final investment for a while.

With the additional Supermicro compute available I have made the Z840 a sort of standalone node. I will keep it around as it’s the only thing capable of running my Nvidia K2.

Late to the party or not, I have been using containers in my lab more and more and that has led me to Portainer…. I use it for managing the docker containers on my Synology but it can also be used for managing lots of other things. In their own words “Portainer accelerates container adoption….

A little while ago I decided to play with vGPU in my homelab. This was something I had dabbled with in the past but never really had the time or need to get working properly. The first thing that I needed was a GPU. I did have a Dell T20 with an iGPU built into…

I run a reasonably extensive homelab that is of course built around the VMware ecosystem. So with the release of vSphere 8 I was obviously going to upgrade however a few personal things blocked me from doing it until now. The vCenter upgrade was smooth however knowing that some of the hardware I am running…
