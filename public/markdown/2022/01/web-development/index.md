# Web Development

A while ago I started messing with Cloudflare Workers. I have now moved this site permanently over to them. This is partly related to some issues I have been having with internet access at home. Prior to this, the site ran from within my lab.

This means the site is now super fast (hopefully :p). It was cached by Cloudflare previously and now it’s served entirely from within their network.

![Web performance report](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2021-12-19-at-19.30.43-2048x751-1-1024x376.png)The speed report looks good

To enable this workflow I have retained a WordPress instance running within a docker instance on my Synology. I have also set up Cloudflare teams to access this.

This allows me to have the convenience of utilising WordPress as a CMS without having to worry about the security aspect as all public content is static. It also means that I don’t care about the uptime of the particular instance.

When I have finished writing the post I use the Simply Static Plugin to Generate the required static files. I then copy these to my wrangler site location on my laptop and ask Wrangler to publish them.
    
    
    wrangler publish --env production

📋 Copy

I wrote a post on the initial setup of Cloudflare Workers heck it out if you are interested in more of how this works.

In my current role, I haven’t used Nutanix however I have good experience using it as the storage platform with vSphere…

I recently sat (and passed the VMware HCI Master Specialist exam (5V0-21.20). I won’t go into any details of the contents but I will comment that I felt the questions were fair and that there wasn’t anything in it to trip you up. The required knowledge was certainly wider than the vSAN specialist exam. This…
