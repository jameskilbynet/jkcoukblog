# Using Content Libraries in VMC to deploy software faster

As part of my role spinning up new SDDC’s to test things is quite a common occurrence. This is both a blessing and a curse. The new SDDC is 100% Vanilla and perfectly self contained. Therefore you can do the testing required, knowing that you won’t impact anything else and you’re not inheriting a legacy setting from previous testing.

However the downside is you need to get the configuration and the software you require into the SDDC. This can take some time. For configuration it’s possible to use IAC tools like Terraform. To speed up the process of deploying software I decided to leverage Content Library specifically for this task. This is a much faster and more reliable way to get what I need into the SDDC.

William Lam has previously [written ](https://williamlam.com/2018/07/creating-a-vsphere-content-library-directly-on-amazon-s3.html#google_vignette)about ways of doing this by utilising AWS S3 as the backend

## Introduction

For those unfamiliar with Content Libraries they are a storage medium for storing templates and ISO files for easy use within a vCentre environment or sharing with other vCentres. You can see some of the recent updates to this feature [here](https://blogs.vmware.com/cloud-foundation/2020/01/22/creating-and-using-content-library/)

## Networking

For this to work you need network connectivity between the source and destination vCentre. For my use case I use my on premises vCentre as the source and VMC as the destination. However you can use VMC as the source if preferable.

![Content Library Flow](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ContentLibraryFlow-1024x358.png)

Usually I don’t utilise/DX for this although It will absolutely work over those connections and would be purely private IP

I have a NAT rule on one of my public IP’s on my Onprem Watchguard Firewall to connect through to the Onprem vCentre. The URL of my vCentre will publicly resolve to this IP. I have restricted this connection to only allow from the public IP of the VMC vCentre. For the VMC vCentre there shouldn’t be any changes required as outbound https is allowed by default on the management gateway.

### Create Publishing Content Library

I already use content libraries extensively in my lab and didn’t need everything uploading to VMC. So I created a new Library just for this purpose and added some select software. If you don’t have a content library or need to create another one. These are the steps you will need to follow.

To create a new Library from the vSphere Client from the top menu select **Content Libraries**

![Content Libary](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ContentLibary-1024x368.png)

Name the Content Library appropriately and add a description.

![Name Location](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NameLocation-1024x440.png)

Configure the Content Library

As this will be the source Content Library we will set this to be a local content library and then enable the publishing feature to allow other vCentre’s to subscribe to this. I choose not to use authentication for this purpose as there is nothing sensitive 

![Configure Content Library](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ConfigureContentLibrary-1024x631.png)

The next step is to define what Datastore the Content Library will reside on.

Here I am using my datastore called “ISO” as it saves my valuable NVMe datastore for workloads.

Ready to complete

![Ready To Complete](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ReadyToComplete-1024x507.png)

Complete the creation and then go back into the Content Library settings. It will show you a Subscription URL which we will need later. Take a copy of the full Subscription URL

![Complete With Url](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/CompleteWithUrl-1024x558.png)

### Create Subscribing Content Library

We need to repeat the procedure in VMC however now we need to create a Subscribed Content Library. Input the URL that we saved earlier

<https://uk-bhr-p-vc-1.jameskilby.cloud:443/cls/vcsp/lib/165734dc-81a8-464a-bbe5-a99e4ae597da/lib.json>

![VMC Subscriber](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/VMCSubscriber-1024x906.png)

## Download content option

There are two options for how you want the Subscribed Content Library to behave on first connection/new content. The first is to synchronise the content as soon as possible. This is what I use. However if you have a large catalogue and not all items are required in the VMC vCentre an option to save storage would be to only download content on demand. The downside to this option is that deployed would take longer, waiting for the item to synchronise before it can be used.

I run a reasonably extensive homelab that is of course built around the VMware ecosystem.

The vCenter upgrade was smooth however knowing that some of the hardware I am running…
