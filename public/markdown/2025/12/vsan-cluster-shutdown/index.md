As can be seen on my Lab Overview page. I have a GPU/Management cluster that is usually running 24×7. I also have a 3x Node vSAN cluster that I use when I need more resources (or specifically if I need vSAN to test with)

This allows me to

To shut down a vSAN cluste,r there is a nice workflow built into vCentre that will orchestrate all the required actions for you

Quite a few changes have happened in the lab recently. so I decided to do a multipart blog on the changes.
