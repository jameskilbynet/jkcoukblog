As can be seen on my Lab Overview page. I have a GPU/Management cluster that is usually running 24×7. I also have a 3x Node vSAN cluster that I use when I need more resources (or specifically if I need vSAN to test with)

This allows me to 

See the overview below

To shut down a vSAN cluster, there is a nice workflow built into vCentre that will orchestrate all the required actions for you

And there you have it…

To restart the cluster, ensure all the hosts are booted. Leave them in maintenance mode and then select “Restart vSAN Services” The workflow will enable them to bring them back into operation.

I am a huge fan of the Runecast product and luckily as a vExpert they give out NFR licences for my lab. One of the really cool features I wanted to mention today was the remediation script function. I have been playing with storage a lot in my lab recently as part of a wider…

Quite a few changes have happened in the lab recently. so I decided to do a multipart blog on the changes. The refresh was triggered by the purchase of a SuperMicro Server (2027TR-H71FRF) chassis with 4x X9DRT Nodes / Blades. This is known as a BigTwin configuration in SuperMicro parlance. This is something I was…
