# Warp – The intelligent terminal

[Warp](http://warp.dev) is helping me run my homelab. It has been a big help for me as although I utilise a lot of linux based tools at home, I am mostly self taught and therefore don’t always use best practices. I also know I take some shortcuts that Is an acceptable risk to me but I strive to do better. Sometimes you just need a helping hand 

Enter Warp…

## Table of Contents

## What is Warp?

Taken from Warps website:

Become a command line power user on day one. Warp combines AI and your dev team’s knowledge in one fast, intuitive terminal.

At the moment I am just using the free model which has some limits. A number of paid options are available and I am defiantly considering them.

## An example of Warp helping me out 

I was running “sudo apt-get update” on one of my servers. This is a server that’s been around the block a bit and runs quite a lot of things and MAY have had some experimentation done in the past :p

📋 Copy

As you can see the command itself returned some errors about things being configured multiple times. However as the command (and actual updates) have run successfully in the past I haven’t really dug into it.

Where the beauty of warp kicked in and said 

![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-14.12.14-1024x95.png)

It then auto executed a cat command to look at the contents of both files and gave me advice based on what it found 

![](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-14.19.09-1024x137.png)

It then showed me the below sudo command it wanted to run and asked if it was ok to run it which I approved
    
    
    sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/backdownload_docker_com_linux_ubuntu.list && sudo apt-get update
    

📋 Copy

Once apt-get had been upgraded the duplicates were no longer in place and a few updates were available. These were installed and then Warp gave me an excellent summary of what changed:

The upgrade has been completed successfully. Three packages were upgraded:

  1. pci.ids
  2. python3-software-properties
  3. software-properties-common

According to the system check:

  * The running kernel is up-to-date
  * No services need to be restarted
  * No containers need to be restarted
  * No user sessions are running outdated binaries
  * No VM guests are running outdated hypervisor binaries

Your system is now up to date with all the latest package versions.

## Conclusion

Although the example above is fairly straightforward and I could have resolved myself, using Warp it was fixed MUCH MUCH faster.

I am using it for more and more complex things. Some of these may take a lot of research or are just plain time consuming. Either way I’m finding Warp a great help at making these things faster and more reliable.

I run a reasonably extensive homelab that is of course built around the VMware ecosystem. So with the release of vSphere 8 I was obviously going to upgrade however a few personal things blocked me from doing it until now. The vCenter upgrade was smooth however knowing that some of the hardware I am running…
