# AWS Status Page – Monitoring Included

## **AWS Status Page – Enhancements**

The tool I deployed [lambstatus](https://lambstatus.github.io/get-started/) supports pulling metrics from AWS Cloudwatch and displaying them. As part of my personal development, I thought I would include this on my status page.

I managed to get this working as can be seen [here. ](https://d1wijjwc03zzo1.cloudfront.net)This is a lambda function running once a minute polling this website and adding the response time into AWS Cloudwatch which Lambstatus is allowed to call. It has been running without a hitch for nearly a month now at **effectively zero cost**

#### Site Response

The guide I followed is very good and is documented in the Git repo [here](https://lambstatus.github.io/set-up-custom-http-s-monitoring/)

A while ago I started messing with Cloudflare Workers. I have now moved this site permanently over to them. This is partly related to some issues I have been having with internet access at home. Prior to this, the site ran from within my lab. This means the site is now super fast (hopefully :p)….

Update: Hoarder has now been renamed to Karakeep due to a trademark issue I’ve been on a mission recently to regain control of my data. I haven’t yet faced the humongous task of moving my main email from Gmail, but I have had some successes with other cloud services and a win is a win…….

As previously mentioned I have been working a lot with VMware Cloud on AWS and one of the questions that often crops up is around an approach to monitoring. This is an interesting topic as VMC is technically “as a service” therefore the monitoring approach is a bit different. Technically AWS and VMware’s SRE teams…

A lot of these are in “the backend” These help improve the performance, Privacy, SEO, and I have also added some security best practices. Most of these changes were done more as an exercise than due to a specific requirement. I also had…
