# AWS Status Page – Monitoring Included

## **AWS Status Page – Enhancements**

The tool I deployed [lambstatus](https://lambstatus.github.io/get-started/) supports pulling metrics from AWS Cloudwatch and displaying them. As part of my personal development, I thought I would include this on my status page.

I managed to get this working as can be seen [here. ](https://d1wijjwc03zzo1.cloudfront.net)This is a lambda function running once a minute polling this website and adding the response time into AWS Cloudwatch which Lambstatus is allowed to call. It has been running without a hitch for nearly a month now at **effectively zero cost**

#### Site Response

The guide I followed is very good and is documented in the Git repo [here](https://lambstatus.github.io/set-up-custom-http-s-monitoring/)

When you run a large enough Infrastructure failure is inevitable. How you handle that can be a big differentiator. With VMware Cloud on AWS, the hosts are monitored 24×7 by VMware/AWS Support all as part of the service. If you pay for X number of hosts you should have X. That includes during maintenance and…

As previously mentioned I have been working a lot with VMware Cloud on AWS and one of the questions that often crops up is around an approach to monitoring. This is an interesting topic as VMC is technically “as a service” therefore the monitoring approach is a bit different. Technically AWS and VMware’s SRE teams…

For a while now I have been running this site directly from Cloudflare utilising their excellent worker’s product. I did this originally as a learning exercise but due to the benefits It brought and the ease of use I decided to stick with it. The benefits are several fold: Crazy Web Performance (Typically full page…

A while ago I started messing with Cloudflare Workers. I have now moved this site permanently over to them. This is partly related to some issues I have been having with internet access at home. Prior to this, the site ran from within my lab. This means the site is now super fast (hopefully :p)….
