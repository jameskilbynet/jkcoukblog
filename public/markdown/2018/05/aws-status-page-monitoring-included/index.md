# AWS Status Page – Monitoring Included

## **AWS Status Page – Enhancements**

The tool I deployed [lambstatus](https://lambstatus.github.io/get-started/) supports pulling metrics from AWS Cloudwatch and displaying them. As part of my personal development, I thought I would include this on my status page.

I managed to get this working as can be seen [here. ](https://d1wijjwc03zzo1.cloudfront.net)This is a lambda function running once a minute polling this website and adding the response time into AWS Cloudwatch which Lambstatus is allowed to call. It has been running without a hitch for nearly a month now at **effectively zero cost**

#### Site Response

The guide I followed is very good and is documented in the Git repo [here](https://lambstatus.github.io/set-up-custom-http-s-monitoring/)

As previously mentioned I have been working a lot with VMware Cloud on AWS and one of the questions that often crops up is around an approach to monitoring. This is an interesting topic as VMC is technically “as a service” therefore the monitoring approach is a bit different. Technically AWS and VMware’s SRE teams…

These are both plumbed into my WatchGuard Firewall with multi-wan configured. Most of the time the usability is ok but there…
