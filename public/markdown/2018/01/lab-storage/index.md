# Lab Storage

I have been meaning to post around some of the lab setup for a while. Although it changes frequently at present it’s as below. I will add some pics when I have tidied up the lab/cables

My primary lab storage is all contained within an HP Gen8 Microserver.

Currently Configured:

1x INTEL Core i3-4130 running at 2.3Ghz

16Gb of RAM

4x 1Gb/s NIC

2x 3TB WD Red

2x Intel SSD 320 Series 80GB, 25nm MLC

This is running Xpenology.

I have the 4 Nics split into two LACP bonds. One for the management traffic and one for pure NFS traffic.

The 2xWD Red’s are in an SHR configuration with the SSDs running as a SSD read-write cache

This gives me 2.6TB Useable which is plenty to lab and store photos and media and with the RW cache, the perf is pretty dam good.

I also have a DS216+II Synology with 2x 2TB WD Red’s this is my tier 2 lab storage. for backups ISO’s etc

I am running a few apps/containers on the Xpenology install as it has a lot more ram/processing power.

At the moment this consists of:

Docker – GitLab

Docker – PHPipam

Plex

I have been a VMware vExpert for many years and it has brought me many many benefits over the years. I don’t think it’s an understatement to say I probably wouldn’t have my current role within VMware without it. One of the best benefits has been access to a huge amount of licences for VMware…

Update: Hoarder has now been renamed to Karakeep due to a trademark issue I’ve been on a mission recently to regain control of my data. I haven’t yet faced the humongous task of moving my main email from Gmail, but I have had some successes with other cloud services and a win is a win…….

My lab is always undergoing change. Partially as I want to try new things or new ways of doing things. Sometimes because I break things (not always by accident) sometimes it’s a great way to learn….
