# Lab Storage

I have been meaning to post around some of the lab setup for a while. Although it changes frequently at present it’s as below. I will add some pics when I have tidied up the lab/cables

My primary lab storage is all contained within an HP Gen8 Microserver.

Currently Configured:

1x INTEL Core i3-4130 running at 2.3Ghz

16Gb of RAM

4x 1Gb/s NIC

2x 3TB WD Red

2x Intel SSD 320 Series 80GB, 25nm MLC

This is running Xpenology.

I have the 4 Nics split into two LACP bonds. One for the management traffic and one for pure NFS traffic.

The 2xWD Red’s are in an SHR configuration with the SSDs running as a SSD read-write cache

This gives me 2.6TB Useable which is plenty to lab and store photos and media and with the RW cache, the perf is pretty dam good.

I also have a DS216+II Synology with 2x 2TB WD Red’s this is my tier 2 lab storage. for backups ISO’s etc

I am running a few apps/containers on the Xpenology install as it has a lot more ram/processing power.

At the moment this consists of:

Docker – GitLab

Docker – PHPipam

Plex

I have retired the WatchGuard Devices with the migration to PFSense running bare-metal in one of the Supermicro Nodes. I will likely virtualise this in the future. In terms of network/switching I have moved to an intermediate step here vMotion and Storage are running over DAC’s while VMware management and VM traffic is still over…

Artificial intelligence is all the rage at the moment, It’s getting included in every product announcement from pretty much every vendor under the sun. Nvidia’s stock price has gone to the moon. So I thought I better get some knowledge and understand some of this. As it’s a huge field and I wasn’t exactly sure…

A little while ago I decided to play with vGPU in my homelab. This was something I had dabbled with in the past but never really had the time or need to get working properly. The first thing that I needed was a GPU. I did have a Dell T20 with an iGPU built into…

Update: Hoarder has now been renamed to Karakeep due to a trademark issue I’ve been on a mission recently to regain control of my data. I haven’t yet faced the humongous task of moving my main email from Gmail, but I have had some successes with other cloud services and a win is a win…….
