# Home Network Upgrade

I have recently moved over to Mikrotik Switching for all of my Home environment as part of my home network upgrade. What started life as a move away from gigabit networking had some serious scope creep. As I needed new switches, network adaptors and cabling I evaluated the obvious choice of just upgrading to 10Gb/s. However, when looking at the price comparison to upgrade to 25Gb/s I felt the cost uplift was justified and certainly better future-proofed. This became the baseline for the majority of my server workloads. The Access switch layer has basically stayed gigabit but with 10Gb/s uplinks.

## Table of Contents

The decision to go to Mikrotik was predominantly based on the huge performance available for limited costs. So far I have been impressed with the switches once I got over the initial steep learning curve of RouterOS. I have purchased several switches spread out over a few months. This coincided with a property move so some extras were bought to accommodate the new layout In the property, my lab was relocated to a dedicated space and I also wanted wired connectivity into my office.

## Switch’s Purchased

[CSS610-8G-2S+](https://mikrotik.com/product/css610_8g_2s_in)| 183.87| OOB Switch| SwitchOS Lite  
Total| | 1406.34| |   
  
The 100Gb/s Switch is effectively my core switch. It only has 4 physical ports however each of these can be split into 4x25gb/s or slower ports if needed. In the current state all 4 ports are used, however I do have 3 remaining breakouts available if needed.

I have then used the 5-Port 10 Gb/s switch sort of as a media translator for connections to the access switches around the house with 10Gb uplinks to distribute the network around the home and present ethernet ports to my devices.

![Network Overview](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Home-Net-overview-1024x633.png)

Mikrotik Switches can typically run one of two operating systems either RouterOS or SwitchOS. (The 3 ethernet port switches will only run SwOS)

SwitchOS is a much simpler setup and is similar to a web-managed switch from other manufacturers. It’s a trivial setup for anyone that’s used a webmanaged switch before. 

The config for these switches takes a little bit of time to get familiar with as they are incredibly powerful. It’s possible to run RouterOS or SwitchOS on them however I could never get SwitchOS to boot correctly on the 100GB/s switch so I stuck with RouterOS and perceived through the config. Part 2 will go into my RouterOS setup.

I have a draft post of the steps I have used to get RouterOS configured how I like. I will try and finish that off when I get some more time.
