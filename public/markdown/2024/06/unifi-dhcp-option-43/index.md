# Configure DHCP Option 43 for UniFi devices to enable remote adoption across subnets

## Intro

I have recently juggled some of my homelab services around, which involved moving my UniFi server to a different subnet. This meant that new UniFi devices could not find the UniFi server for adoption/control purposes as this is usually done with broadcast.

## Layer 3 Adoption Options

For Remote Adoption/Layer 3 UniFi supports:

  * SSH
  * DNS
  * DHCP Option 43

I discounted SSH as who wants to manually log into things and make changes and I discounted DNS. That left me with DHCP option 43

I decided to configure my DHCP server to hand out “option 43” on the network subnet the Access Points were connected to. The implementation of this will differ depending on what DHCP server you are using. Mine is the one built into my WatchGuard Firebox M200.

In this, I have set a custom option and then it asks for four values:

Code| 43  
---|---  
Name | Unifi  
Type | Hexadecimal  
Value | 01:04:c0:a8:14:02  
  
All of which are straightforward except the last one so let me explain. It is made up of 2 parts

The first two parts 01:04 Is fixed for UniFi. I am hosting the controller on IP 192.168.20.2 The remaining part of the value (c0:a8:14:02) is the IP address of the UniFi controller in Hex. Please note this method does not support DNS.

A multitude of tools exist for converting IP to HEX one can be found [here](https://www.browserling.com/tools/ip-to-hex)

And there you have it. I can connect a factory fresh UniFi device to my network DHCP will hand out an IP on one subnet and tell the device how to reach the controller in a different subnet.

Lab Storage Update. Since starting my new role with Xtravirt my Homelab has gone through several fairly significant changes. At the moment it’s very much focused on the VMware stack and one of the things I needed was some more storage and especially some more storage performance. With that in mind, I purchased a new Synology…

I have been a VMware vExpert for many years and it has brought me many many benefits over the years. I don’t think it’s an understatement to say I probably wouldn’t have my current role within VMware without it. One of the best benefits has been access to a huge amount of licences for VMware…

Since moving to Dorset last year internet connectivity has been the bane of my existence. Currently, I have an ADSL connection provided by my old employer Zen and a 5G connection provided by Three. These are both plumbed into my WatchGuard Firewall with multi-wan configured. Most of the time the usability is ok but there…

Yes, that’s a clickbait title. But technically it’s possible if I dropped all drive redundancy… I recently saw an advert for a server that was just too good to be true. It promised to bring a huge amount of storage and future options in a quite hard-to-believe 1U. The price it was on offer for…
