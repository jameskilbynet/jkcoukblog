# Template Deployment with Packer

Packer is one of those tools I have heard about, and some of the cool people on Twitter that I follow have been using it for a while. But until now I had never played with it. That was until I saw the below tweet by the legend that is [William Lam](https://williamlam.com/)

[View Tweet: https://twitter.com/lamw/status/1333546472155987969](https://twitter.com/lamw/status/1333546472155987969)

That was the kicker I needed to go and have a look at getting it set up and running. As I run a Mac as my main machine it was easy to get deployed following the instructions using [brew](https://brew.sh) and the GitHub Repo that William had pointed to.

However, once I had added my vSphere credentials I was having a few issues. On execution, I was getting the error message “default datacenter resolves to multiple instances” I did a bit of digging and discovered that the code didn’t specify a VMware datacenter and in my lab environment, I have 2 physical sites with a VMware datacenter in each, therefore, I needed to specify which one. Once this was fixed I started rolling out some Linux templates and it worked flawlessly until I got to the photon 4 server. I again spotted a typo and a syntax error on a command being passed into the photon VM. I corrected this and decided that actually, I should work out how to get this fixed upstream to help the wider community.

Once this was working it was onto the Windows templates. Once all the relevant ISO’s and configs were in place I was able to fully deploy 4 Windows servers that were patched and added to my content library in about 40mins. So whenever I go to deploy an Image it is always up to date…

Lab Storage Update. Since starting my new role with Xtravirt my Homelab has gone through several fairly significant changes. At the moment it’s very much focused on the VMware stack and one of the things I needed was some more storage and especially some more storage performance. With that in mind, I purchased a new Synology…

My lab is always undergoing change. Partially as I want to try new things or new ways of doing things. Sometimes because I break things (not always by accident) sometimes it’s a great way to learn…. I decided to list the workloads I am looking to run (some of these are already in place) Infrastucture…
