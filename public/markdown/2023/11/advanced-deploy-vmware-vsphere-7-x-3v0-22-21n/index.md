# Advanced Deploy VMware vSphere 7.x 3V0-22.21N

Yesterday I sat and passed the above exam. It had been on my todo list for a good number of years. With the current pause in the Broadcom VMware takeover deal. I had some downtime and decided to use one of the three exam vouchers VMware give me each year. This upgrades me to a a VMware Certified Advanced Professional.

The VCAP Deploy exams are lab based and use a similar infrastructure to the hands on labs. In my experience the whole setup was quite slick. If you know your way around vSphere pretty comprehensively or have done the appropriate studying then I think it was a fair assessment. The [blueprint](https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/certification/vmware-advanced-deploy-exam-guide.pdf) covers everything you need. So whats stopping you…

I have now scheduled the VCAP-Design exam and hopefully I will be able to pass that and receive the VCIX award.

I have been a VMware vExpert for many years and it has brought me many many benefits over the years. I don’t think it’s an understatement to say I probably wouldn’t have my current role within VMware without it. One of the best benefits has been access to a huge amount of licences for VMware…

There is a lot of uncertainty with VMware at the moment. This is all due to the pending acquisition by Broadcom. There are a lot of unknowns for the staff and customers about what the company will look like in the future. I certainly have some concerns mainly just with the unknown. However, VMware has…
