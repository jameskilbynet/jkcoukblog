As everyone knows by now the world has changed possibly forever. Due to Covid19 working from home has become the new normal. We are lucky in the IT world that this has been fairly straightforward for most of us. We are privileged in that it’s possible for us to continue indefinitely. Organisations still need to move forward, to progress and adapt into the new normal.

In the words of Charles Darwin “ _It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change.”_

With that most (if not all IT conferences have been postponed or gone online) Veeam’s annual conference VeeamON is no exception and now it’s here!!

As previously mentioned I have been working a lot with VMware Cloud on AWS and one of the questions that often crops up is around an approach to monitoring.
