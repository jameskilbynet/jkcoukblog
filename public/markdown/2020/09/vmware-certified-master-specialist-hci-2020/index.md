# VMware Certified Master Specialist HCI 2020

I recently sat (and passed the VMware HCI Master Specialist exam (5V0-21.20). I won’t go into any details of the contents but I will comment that I felt the questions were fair and that there wasn’t anything in it to trip you up. The required knowledge was certainly wider than the vSAN specialist exam.

This was my third remote proctored exam and I must say the experience has improved. Partially that is down to Pearson Vue improving the process and partially down to knowing what to expect a bit better.

Together with the vSAN exam that I passed earlier in the month, this entitles me to a [VMware Master Services Competency](https://www.vmware.com/education-services/certification/vmware-ms-hci.html). This is now the second that I hold and I must say I like the way VMware is delivering a thought out learning path.

Quite a few changes have happened in the lab recently. so I decided to do a multipart blog on the changes. The refresh was triggered by the purchase of a SuperMicro Server (2027TR-H71FRF) chassis with 4x X9DRT Nodes / Blades. This is known as a BigTwin configuration in SuperMicro parlance. This is something I was…

As previously mentioned I have been working a lot with VMware Cloud on AWS and one of the questions that often crops up is around an approach to monitoring. This is an interesting topic as VMC is technically “as a service” therefore the monitoring approach is a bit different. Technically AWS and VMware’s SRE teams…

Given the year that was 2020 and at the time of writing a distinct improvement appears a long way off I decided it was time to up my homeworking game. I bought a beautiful Dell 49″ monitor back in mid-2020 that has been the central focus of my home office. With this setup I always…
