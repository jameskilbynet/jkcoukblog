# VMware Certified Master Specialist HCI 2020

I recently sat (and passed the VMware HCI Master Specialist exam (5V0-21.20). I won’t go into any details of the contents but I will comment that I felt the questions were fair and that there wasn’t anything in it to trip you up. The required knowledge was certainly wider than the vSAN specialist exam.

This was my third remote proctored exam and I must say the experience has improved. Partially that is down to Pearson Vue improving the process and partially down to knowing what to expect a bit better.

Together with the vSAN exam that I passed earlier in the month, this entitles me to a [VMware Master Services Competency](https://www.vmware.com/education-services/certification/vmware-ms-hci.html). This is now the second that I hold and I must say I like the way VMware is delivering a thought out learning path.

VMware Cloud on AWS (VMC) has introduced a new host to its lineup the “i3en”. This is based on the i3en.metal AWS instance. The specifications are certainly impressive packing in 96 logical cores, 768GiB RAM, and approximately 45.84 TiB of NVMe raw storage capacity per host. It’s certainly a monster with a 266% uplift in…

As previously mentioned I have been working a lot with VMware Cloud on AWS and one of the questions that often crops up is around an approach to monitoring. This is an interesting topic as VMC is technically “as a service” therefore the monitoring approach is a bit different. Technically AWS and VMware’s SRE teams…
