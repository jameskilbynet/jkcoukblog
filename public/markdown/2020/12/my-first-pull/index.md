# My First Pull

By[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) December 22, 2020December 8, 2025 • 📖1 min read(187 words)

📅 **Published:** December 22, 2020• **Updated:** December 08, 2025

I was initially going to add in the contents of this post to one that I have been writing about my exploits with HashiCorp Packer but I decided it probably warranted being separated out. While working with the following awesome project I noticed a couple of minor errors and Improvements that I wanted to suggest. I have worked in IT for over 10 years now but the opportunity to make suggestions to someone else’s codebase hadn’t popped up so I was keen to rectify that. Although I had used Git/GitHub before it was typically for my own uses as a code storage location. I, therefore, needed to sanity check the process of a “pull request” so off to YouTube I went.

The above video seemed to clarify the process the best and with that knowledge, the request was submitted to the owners and luckily it was accepted.

You can see that I am now listed as a contributor [here](https://github.com/rainpole/packer-vsphere/graphs/contributors). Although my contribution was tiny, now that I understand the process much better I am planning to contribute some more to what is a fantastic little project.
