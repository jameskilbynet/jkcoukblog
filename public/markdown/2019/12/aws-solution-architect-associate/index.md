# AWS Solution Architect – Associate

Today was a good day. I renewed my AWS Solution Architect certification. Although my work is primarily in and around the VMware ecosystem I have been working a lot with [VMware Cloud on AWS](https://console.cloud.broadcom.com) recently with a number of our customers. Having a good foundation of the core AWS services has made this much easier to be able to articulate to the customers.

Due to the non-disclosure agreement, I can’t talk about any specific questions however I will say that the questions and the focus have changed quite significantly since I sat the exam a few years ago. Like AWS itself they were at the cutting edge of the industry and the number of services they now offer is extreme, adding to the challenge of the exam. I am now good for the next three years however I am planning to sit the Professional level exam in the new year.

I saw a tweet a couple of weeks ago mentioning that Nutanix were offering a free go at the Nutanix Certified Professional exam. They are also offering free on-demand training to go with it. In my current role, I haven’t used Nutanix however I have good experience using it as the storage platform with vSphere…

A while ago I started messing with Cloudflare Workers. I have now moved this site permanently over to them. This is partly related to some issues I have been having with internet access at home. Prior to this, the site ran from within my lab. This means the site is now super fast (hopefully :p)….

AWS Status Page – Enhancements The tool I deployed lambstatus supports pulling metrics from AWS Cloudwatch and displaying them.

I recently sat (and passed the VMware HCI Master Specialist exam (5V0-21.20). I won’t go into any details of the contents but I will comment that I felt the questions were fair and that there wasn’t anything in it to trip you up. The required knowledge was certainly wider than the vSAN specialist exam. This…
