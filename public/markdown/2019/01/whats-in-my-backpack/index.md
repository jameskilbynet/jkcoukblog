# Whats in my backpack?

I have seen a few posts online recently about the tools and technology people use on a day to day basis. A few components that I have no one seems to have mentioned yet. So I thought it was probably a good idea to share my list. I will probably do a separate list of the software I use at some point as well.

Below is a list of the things that I tend to carry in my bag. I don’t always have all of them with me but I typically swap out what I need as appropriate depending on if need to go to a datacenter or just a meeting/onsite client work.

  * Macbook Air 2018 ( My goto machine)
  * iPad Pro 9.7 & Apple Pencil allows for quick sketching but also used as a presentation remote.
  * [Anker Powercore 20100](https://amzn.to/2TGRgiq) ( Huge battery for keeping iPhone/iPad charged)
  * Beats Solo3 Wireless headphones. Equally useful in a noisy datacenter or a noisy office.
  * 2.5″ USB Drive caddy
  * A bunch of USB Sticks typically with a few different ESX builds 6.0, 6.5 and 6.7 and an empty one just in case
  * EasyAcc Wireless Storage PowerBank – Battery powered AP ( Insanely useful device)
  * Huawei 3G Mifi
  * Startech USB KVM (Another lifesaver)
  * Apple Lightning to HDMI Adaptor + HDMI cable
  * Leatherman Wingman
  * Led Headtorch
  * Dymo portable label printer
  * Trusty vendor supplied notepad and pens.

Based on the recommendation of [Chris Lewis](https://twitter.com/thecloudxpert) I have also added some [Whiteboard](https://amzn.to/2CbHTQW) & [Flipchart](https://amzn.to/2CbHTQW) Pens

Oh and a Tie……

Given the year that was 2020 and at the time of writing a distinct improvement appears a long way off I decided it was time to up my homeworking game. I bought a beautiful Dell 49″ monitor back in mid-2020 that has been the central focus of my home office. With this setup I always…
