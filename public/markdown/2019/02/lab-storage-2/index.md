# Lab Storage

## Lab Storage Update.

Since starting my new role with Xtravirt my Homelab has gone through several fairly significant changes. At the moment it’s very much focused on the VMware stack and one of the things I needed was some more storage and especially some more storage performance. With that in mind, I purchased a new Synology DS918

It’s a very compact unit with a quad-core Intel Celeron & I have left the RAM at 4 GB for now.

I have added some of the existing SSD’s that I had giving me about 3TB of usable flash. I am presenting this back to my VMware hosts using NFS 4.1. I must have missed the announcement as this is now built into the Synology GUI ( It used to be a command-line-only option) I have verified the VAAI works as expected in this configuration. At present I am using this with a single network connection however I will be testing NFS Multipathing shortly.

The performance improvement has been noticeable and I have now removed all non-Synology systems from primary storage. This has left me with the DS918+ detailed here and a DS216+ with 2TB of Raid1 WD Reds. I am using this for ISO’s and some general file storage.

Update: Hoarder has now been renamed to Karakeep due to a trademark issue I’ve been on a mission recently to regain control of my data. I haven’t yet faced the humongous task of moving my main email from Gmail, but I have had some successes with other cloud services and a win is a win…….

I have been a VMware vExpert for many years and it has brought me many many benefits over the years. I don’t think it’s an understatement to say I probably wouldn’t have my current role within VMware without it. One of the best benefits has been access to a huge amount of licences for VMware…

Quite a few changes have happened in the lab recently. so I decided to do a multipart blog on the changes. The refresh was triggered by the purchase of a SuperMicro Server (2027TR-H71FRF) chassis with 4x X9DRT Nodes / Blades. This is known as a BigTwin configuration in SuperMicro parlance. This is something I was…
