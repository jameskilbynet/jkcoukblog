## Lab Storage Update.

Since starting my new role with Xtravirt my Homelab has gone through several fairly significant changes. At the moment it’s very much focused on the VMware stack and one of the things I needed was some more storage and especially some more storage performance. With that in mind, I purchased a new Synology DS918

It’s a very compact unit with a quad-core Intel Celeron & I have left the RAM at 4 GB for now.

I have added some of the existing SSD’s that I had giving me about 3TB of usable flash. I am presenting this back to my VMware hosts using NFS 4.1. I must have missed the announcement as this is now built into the Synology GUI ( It used to be a command-line-only option) I have verified the VAAI works as expected in this configuration. At present I am using this with a single network connection however I will be testing NFS Multipathing shortly.

The performance improvement has been noticeable and I have now removed all non-Synology systems from primary storage. This has left me with the DS918+ detailed here and a DS216+ with 2TB of Raid1 WD Reds. I am using this for ISO’s and some general file storage.

For a while, I’ve been looking to update the networking at the core of my homelab. I have had some great results with the current setup utilising a number of DAC’s but there were a couple of things that were annoying me. Then MikroTik dropped the CRS504-4XQ-IN and if the price wasn’t horrendous then that…

I have been a VMware vExpert for many years and it has brought me many many benefits over the years. I don’t think it’s an understatement to say I probably wouldn’t have my current role within VMware without it. One of the best benefits has been access to a huge amount of licences for VMware…

Yes, that’s a clickbait title. But technically it’s possible if I dropped all drive redundancy… I recently saw an advert for a server that was just too good to be true. It promised to bring a huge amount of storage and future options in a quite hard-to-believe 1U. The price it was on offer for…
