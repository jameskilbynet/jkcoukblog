# For Cloudflare Pages static site deployment
# The Pages service will handle the static files from the 'public' directory
# No [site] configuration needed - that was for the deprecated Workers Sites

# Pages configuration is handled in the Cloudflare dashboard:
# - Build output directory: public
# - Build command: (empty for pre-built static sites)
# - Root directory: (empty or /)
